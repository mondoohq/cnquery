// MinDowngradeMajor is the oldest major a downgrade can ever target.
//
// The mechanism that consumes translations - the $translate chunk and the
// patcher - ships in v14. A v13 reader receives a bundle carrying translations,
// ignores the field it does not understand, and runs the primary code, so
// nothing below 14 can be served no matter what we emit for it.
const MinDowngradeMajor = 14

// DowngradeMajorSpan is how many majors back the default floor reaches.
const DowngradeMajorSpan = 2

// DefaultDowngradeFloor returns the oldest version of each provider that content
// compiled here should still run on.
//
// The window is the current major minus two, clamped at MinDowngradeMajor, and
// always the .0.0 of that major - a floor is a support boundary, not a specific
// release, so it takes in every patch of the oldest major it serves:
//
//	provider 15.1.2  ->  14.0.0   (15-2 is 13, clamped to 14)
//	provider 17.1.2  ->  15.0.0
//	provider 16.4.0  ->  14.0.0
//
// A provider still on a major below MinDowngradeMajor gets no floor at all
// rather than a floor above its own version. The distinction matters for more
// than tidiness: an unset floor means the compiler never asks that provider for
// a catalog, and asking means starting the provider. Emitting a floor nothing
// could consume would pay that cost for nothing.
//
// An unparseable version is skipped for the same reason. Guessing a floor from a
// version we cannot read risks either withholding fallbacks that would have
// worked or emitting ones that cannot.
