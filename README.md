This project contains query packs used with [`cnquery`](https://github.com/mondoohq/cnquery). We've organized them into these directories:

- [core](core) - Core packs contain baseline queries such as incidence response probes for different targets. Core query packs are maintained by Mondoo and have strict quality requirements.
- [extra](extra) - Extra packs are are a mix of community- and Mondoo-maintained queries that are outside Mondoo's core support tier.
- [community](community) - Community packs are primarily maintained by the community with support from the Mondoo team. Community packs may move to extra or core over time.
