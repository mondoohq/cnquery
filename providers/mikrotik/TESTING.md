# MikroTik Provider Testing

## Overview

This document covers standing up a MikroTik RouterOS device in AWS for provider
development and validation, and the traps that cost time the first time. All of
it is verified against **CloudEOS-equivalent MikroTik CHR 7.23.2** launched from
the AWS Marketplace.

A full run — launch, configure, sweep every resource, tear down — takes about
20 minutes and costs a few cents.

---

## Prerequisites

- An AWS account subscribed to [MikroTik Cloud Hosted Router](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp?sku=blez4ywfw64kidgmc4v6vyjoa)
- `terraform`, `aws` CLI, and a built provider (`make providers/build/mikrotik && make providers/install/mikrotik`)

### Licensing

CHR is **BYOL on Marketplace, with no software charge**, and its free license
level runs indefinitely: 1 Mbps per interface, every other feature unrestricted.
That cap is irrelevant for provider work, since the provider only reads
configuration over the RouterOS API and never passes traffic. You pay for EC2
and nothing else.

### Finding the AMI

Unlike some network-appliance listings, the CHR image **is** publicly
discoverable:

```bash
aws ec2 describe-images --owners aws-marketplace \
  --filters "Name=name,Values=*CHR*" --region us-west-2 \
  --query 'Images[].[ImageId,Name,ProductCodes[0].ProductCodeId]' --output text
# ami-01af9289831640581  CHR RouterOS 7.23.2-...  blez4ywfw64kidgmc4v6vyjoa
```

Confirm the account can actually launch it before writing any Terraform — a
subscription can take a few minutes to propagate, and until it does the error
is `OptInRequired`:

```bash
aws ec2 run-instances --dry-run --region us-west-2 \
  --image-id <ami-id> --instance-type t3.small --subnet-id <subnet>
# want: DryRunOperation ("Request would have succeeded")
```

To check what an account holds:

```bash
aws license-manager list-received-licenses --region us-west-2 \
  --query 'Licenses[].ProductName' --output text | tr '\t' '\n' | grep -i "cloud hosted"
```

**If you cannot subscribe**, MikroTik publishes the CHR raw disk image and
there is an official guide for [importing it as your own AMI](https://help.mikrotik.com/docs/spaces/RKB/pages/161611810/Create+an+RouterOS+CHR+7.6+AMI)
via S3 and VM Import/Export. That needs a `vmimport` IAM role and takes longer,
but requires no Marketplace subscription at all.

---

## Instance and security group

`t3.small` is plenty — CHR needs 256 MB RAM minimum, 1 GB recommended, 128 MB
disk. At the time of writing that is **$0.0208/hr** in `us-west-2`.

The provider speaks the **RouterOS API**, not SSH or REST, so the security
group opens different ports than you might expect:

| Port | Purpose |
|---|---|
| 8728 | RouterOS API, **plaintext** |
| 8729 | RouterOS API over TLS (`api-ssl`) |
| 22 | SSH, only needed to bootstrap the device |

Restrict all three to your own address. Both API ports are **enabled by default**
on the CHR image, so the device is reachable as soon as it boots — there is no
service to turn on first.

CHR boots fast: the API answers roughly 10 seconds after `terraform apply`
returns.

---

## Bootstrapping

MikroTik does **not** document EC2 user-data support for CHR (cloud-init is
documented for Hetzner and Vultr, not AWS), so do not bake configuration into
user-data and hope. Launch with an EC2 key pair and configure over SSH.

The default account is `admin` with **no password**:

```bash
ssh -i <key> admin@<ip> "/system/resource/print"
```

Set a password so the provider can authenticate:

```bash
ssh -n -i <key> admin@<ip> "/user set admin password=<password>"
```

### Applying a lab config

Two things will bite when scripting this:

**`ssh` eats stdin inside a read loop.** Applying a config file line by line
with `while read cmd; do ssh ... "$cmd"; done < file` silently runs only the
first line, because `ssh` consumes the rest of the loop's input. Use `ssh -n`.

**`/import` needs the file on the device**, and `scp` does not put it where
RouterOS looks by default. Running the commands directly over SSH is simpler
and gives you a per-command pass/fail, which is what you want when some
commands are version-dependent.

A few commands that a current CHR rejects, worth knowing before you debug them:

| Command | Result on CHR 7.23.2 |
|---|---|
| `/system logging action add name=lab-remote ...` | action names accept **letters and numbers only** — no hyphens |
| `/interface ovpn-server server set enabled=yes` | syntax error unless a certificate is also given |
| `/container`, `/ip/firewall/connection-tracking`, `/system/routerboard` | `no such command prefix` — absent on CHR |

`sflow`, physical-hardware menus, and anything RouterBOARD-specific do not
exist on a virtual router. `mikrotik.system.routerboard` correctly reports
`false` there.

---

## Pointing mql at it

```bash
export PROVIDERS_PATH="$HOME/.config/mondoo/providers"
mql run mikrotik "admin@<ip>" --password "<password>" --auto-update=false \
  -c 'mikrotik { system { version boardName } }'
```

`--auto-update=false` matters: without it mql can replace your locally-built
provider with the released one mid-run, and you end up validating code you did
not build.

### Query private resources through their parent

Most of this provider's resources are `private`, and reaching one by its dotted
path returns a husk — every field null, with
`provider returned no data and no error for a field`:

```bash
mql run mikrotik ... -c 'mikrotik.system.version'          # null
mql run mikrotik ... -c 'mikrotik { system { version } }'  # "7.23.2 (stable)"
```

Always go through the parent accessor when validating, or you will chase a
provider bug that is not there.

### TLS

`--tls` selects port 8729 and does a real TLS handshake. On a stock CHR that
**fails**, because `api-ssl` has no certificate bound by default:

```
failed to connect ... :8729: could not connect to router os: remote error: tls: handshake failure
```

Generate and bind a self-signed certificate on the device first if you need to
exercise the TLS path.

## Capturing fixtures for unit tests

The provider's unit tests are driven by rows captured from a real device, in
`resources/testdata/live/`. They are the exact `map[string]string` the RouterOS
API hands to an args builder, so a builder that mishandles a real row's shape
fails in a unit test rather than in a scan.

To refresh them, dump every menu the provider reads through the same client the
provider uses:

```bash
# the menus, straight from the source
grep -rhoE 'Print(One)?(Optional)?\("([^"]+)"' resources/*.go \
  | grep -oE '"/[^"]+"' | tr -d '"' | sort -u
```

Then connect with `github.com/go-routeros/routeros/v3`, run `<menu>/print` for
each, and write `reply.Re[i].Map` out as JSON. Capturing through the CLI instead
would be wrong: `/system/resource/print` pretty-prints `1766.6MiB`, while the
API returns the raw `2113929216` that the provider actually parses.

---

## Tear down, and verify per service

Tag everything through Terraform `default_tags` so a crashed run is still
findable, then confirm deletion against the owning service. The Resource Groups
Tagging API lags by hours and will keep listing resources that are already gone:

```bash
aws ec2 describe-instances --region us-west-2 \
  --filters "Name=tag:mondoo-run-id,Values=$RUN_ID" \
            "Name=instance-state-name,Values=running,pending,stopping,stopped" \
  --query 'length(Reservations[].Instances[])' --output text
```

If you took the VM Import route, remember the `vmimport` IAM role and the S3
staging bucket are not in Terraform state and must be removed separately.
