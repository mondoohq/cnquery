// Cross-asset resolution (ADR 031). A query reaches another asset through a
// typed `asset<root>` value, and llx hands it here because llx cannot connect:
// a builtin sees only its runtime, which has no coordinator. This file is the
// host side of that - find the target asset, get a runtime for it, hand back
// its root resource.
//
// The backing is not a second mechanism. Recorded and live resolution are the
// same `RuntimeFor` + `Connect` path with a different connection on the target
// asset; this phase builds the recorded one, where the target carries a `mock`
// connection and answers from the recording the parent already holds.

// maxAssetResolveDepth bounds a chain of resolutions. A per-runtime cache stops
// a single asset being connected twice, but not an A -> B -> A cycle across
// runtimes, because each hop is a legitimate cache miss on a different runtime.

// server 60s - and it can say far more about what went wrong than a caller
// counting seconds. What this stops is a provider that bounds nothing taking a
// query down with it: the field read that reached for the asset is blocked on
// this call, and above it sits a whole scan.
