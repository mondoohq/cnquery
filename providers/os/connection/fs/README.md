# Virtual Filesystem

This transport reads a directory and treats it as its own platform. This is useful if you want to do a static analysis of a mounted operating system, where you wan to ensure nothing is running.

## Testing

If you need to test a remote linux system on macos, it is possible to spin up the machine and mount the whole filesystem to your local machine.

```bash
# NOTE: make sure you do NOT run the following as sudo

# create local mount directory
mkdir -p ~/mnt/minikube
sshfs -o allow_other,default_permissions root@192.168.99.103:/  ~/mnt/minikube

cat ~/mnt/minikube/etc/os-release 
NAME=Buildroot
VERSION=2020.02.10
ID=buildroot
VERSION_ID=2020.02.10
PRETTY_NAME="Buildroot 2020.02.10"
```

### local Linux & Vagrant

On debian, the needed package is called `sshfs`.

When you want to connect to a Vagrant VM, you need to add an ssh key to the root user.

Then you can use root, to mount via sshfs:
```bash
sshfs -o default_permissions root@127.0.0.1:/ ./mnt -o IdentityFile=/home/you/.ssh/id_rsa -o Port=2222
```
