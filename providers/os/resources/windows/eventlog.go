// Microsoft-Windows-PowerShell/Operational is not there at all, and reading
// only that key reports a modern channel as absent rather than as
// unconfigured.

// The stored LogFilePath carries %SystemRoot% unexpanded, which cannot be
// handed to file or windows.acl as it stands. The expansion is deliberately
// not done here with [System.Environment]::ExpandEnvironmentVariables: a
// static method call is refused in ConstrainedLanguage mode, which WDAC and
// AppLocker put a host into, and the refusal fails the whole payload rather
// than just that one value. The system root is carried out as data instead and
// the substitution happens in Go, where it is also testable.
//
// A name that matches no channel makes the command fail, which is the right
// answer: "there is no such channel" must not read as "the channel is
// disabled".
