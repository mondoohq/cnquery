// The spec also requires the namespace when a channel is present, since a
// channel alone does not identify the recipe's origin. A malformed reference
// carrying a channel and no user therefore drops the channel rather than
// emitting a purl that cannot round-trip.
//
// The recipe revision is deliberately omitted, though the spec permits an
// `rrev` qualifier. The purl is the correlation key an advisory is matched on,
// and no advisory will ever state a recipe revision — it identifies the exact
// recipe content that produced a build, which is below the granularity anyone
// publishes vulnerabilities at. Including it can only turn a match into a miss.
// User and channel are the opposite case: they change WHICH package this is, so
// omitting them makes a private package inherit the public one's advisories.
