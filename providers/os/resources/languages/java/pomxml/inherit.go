// Inheriting a POM's versions from the artifacts it points at.
//
// A pom.xml routinely declares a dependency with no <version> at all:
//
//	<dependency>
//	  <groupId>com.h2database</groupId>
//	  <artifactId>h2</artifactId>
//	</dependency>
//
// That is not unusual, it is the standard Spring Boot layout and the shape of
// any project with a corporate parent: the version is stated once, in a parent
// POM or an imported BOM, and inherited. Reading only this file yields no
// version, and a purl with no version matches no advisory and no registry — so
// the dependency is silently exempt from the vulnerability correlation and
// licence lookup a caller believes it ran.
//
// The parent's coordinates are right there in <parent>, and on a machine that
// has built the project its POM is already on disk. What is missing is
// permission to go and read it: the parser is deliberately hermetic, and a
// parser that reaches into $HOME on its own is neither testable nor
// predictable. So the caller supplies the artifacts through ParentResolver, and
// with none supplied the parser behaves exactly as it did before.
//
// What is NOT done here matters as much. A version no readable POM supplies
// stays empty. There is no "nearest version in the local repository" fallback
// and no "latest wins": a wrong version is worse than an absent one, because it
// correlates the project against a different release's advisories, which can
// both invent a vulnerability the user does not have and conceal one they do.

// ParentResolver supplies the POM for a parent or imported-BOM coordinate.
//
// A false return is a GAP — the artifact could not be read — never an assertion
// that the coordinate does not exist. Callers treat it as "this version stays
// unresolved", which is the same state as having no resolver at all.
