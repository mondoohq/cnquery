// Staging exists because Encode has a ceiling that a script can grow past
// without anything saying so. Encode widens the script to UTF-16 and base64
// encodes it, so the command line is roughly 2.7x the source; past
// MaxCommandLength the target rejects the command *before* PowerShell runs and
// the caller gets a non-zero exit with no stdout — which reads like the queried
// feature being absent rather than like a script that outgrew its transport.
//
// The ceiling is also not one number. Over SSH the command reaches
// CreateProcess directly and the practical limit is around 32k; over WinRM it
// is routed through cmd.exe and the limit is MaxCommandLength (8191). A script
// verified over SSH is therefore still untested against the tighter of the two.
//
// Staging removes the ceiling entirely: the script is written to a file on the
// target and run with `-File`, so the command line carries a path rather than a
// program.
