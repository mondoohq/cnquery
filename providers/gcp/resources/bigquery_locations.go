// bigqueryLocations is every location BigQuery serves, named as the API names
// them: the two multi-regions, the single regions, and the BigQuery Omni
// locations that sit in AWS and Azure.
//
// The set has to be enumerated because neither API this drives accepts a
// wildcard parent. `projects/<p>/locations/-/reservations`,
// `.../capacityCommitments` and `.../reservations:searchAllAssignments` are all
// rejected with INVALID_ARGUMENT, and there is no project-wide list endpoint
// for connections either, so a caller has to name each location it wants.
//
// This list previously came from the project's own dataset locations, on the
// assumption that a region holding no dataset holds no reservation or
// connection. That assumption is wrong in both directions that matter. Slot
// capacity is routinely bought in a region where the project holds no dataset,
// because queries may run against datasets in another project, and a connection
// to Cloud SQL, Spanner, or an Omni region needs no dataset at all. A project
// with no datasets therefore reported nothing at all while the API held both.
//
// Sourced from https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/locations. It needs
// updating as Google adds locations, and a location missing from here is
// invisible rather than reported, which is why the list lives in one place with
// this note attached to it.

// How a failure is handled is the point of this helper, because the bug it
// replaces was a silent empty list:
//
//   - The API not being enabled on the project means there is genuinely nothing
//     to find in any location, so it degrades to an empty result.
//   - A location that does not apply is skipped. Most of the list is expected
//     to answer this way for any given project.
//   - Anything else, a permission denial above all, is a failure. If no
//     location succeeded, the failure is returned rather than an empty list:
//     "we were not allowed to look" must not arrive looking like "there is
//     nothing here", or every assertion over the result passes vacuously.
//   - If some locations succeeded and others failed, the partial result is
//     returned and the failures are logged, because failing the whole field
//     over one unreachable location would hide the reservations that were read.
