// serviceGate answers "is this API enabled on this project" once per service
// resource, from whichever construction path reaches it first.
//
// The problem it exists to make impossible: a gcp.project.<service> resource is
// reachable three ways -- through the gcp.project.<service>() accessor, by its
// own type name (gcp.project.cloudRunService.services), or built by another
// resource's init with CreateResource -- and only the first of those knows
// whether the API is enabled. A resource that stores that answer in a plain
// bool therefore reads the Go zero value `false` on the other two paths, and
// every collection on it returns an empty list with no error.
//
// An empty list is the worst possible wrong answer here. It is an authoritative
// "there is nothing in this project", so a posture check over it passes
// vacuously rather than failing or erroring. This was verified live: with the
// bare flag, gcp.project.cloudRunService.services returned [] while
// gcp.project.cloudRun.services returned the real service.
//
// Embed this in the resource's Internal struct and the resolution comes with
// it, so a new service cannot reintroduce the bug by forgetting to copy 25
// lines:
//
//	type mqlGcpProjectBatchServiceInternal struct {
//		serviceGate
//	}
//
//	func (g *mqlGcpProjectBatchService) isEnabled() (bool, error) {
//		return g.resolveEnabled(g.MqlRuntime, g.ProjectId, service_batch)
//	}

// resolveEnabled reports whether service is enabled on the project, resolving
// it at most once. It is safe to call from concurrent field accessors.
//
// A resolution failure -- a serviceusage permission gap, the Service Usage API
// itself disabled, the phantom empty-project-id discovery asset -- is returned,
// never folded into `false`. Callers must propagate it: reporting "nothing
// here" for a project that was never successfully checked is the vacuous-pass
// failure this whole type exists to prevent.

//
// It claims the same sync.Once rather than writing the field directly, which is
// what makes it race-free against a concurrent resolveEnabled: whichever call
// arrives first wins and the other becomes a no-op. Both compute the same
// answer, so the order does not matter -- except that a resolveEnabled which
// already failed keeps its error rather than having it overwritten by a later
// recordEnabled.

// serviceEnabledForInit reports whether service is enabled on projectId.
//
// The serviceGate above is embedded in a service resource's Internal struct,
// which init functions cannot use: they are plain functions with no receiver to
// hang state on. They need the check just as much, though, and for a more
// expensive reason -- an init that goes straight to a per-resource Get against a
// disabled API fails, and the failure is not cached, so it is repeated for every
// referrer on every asset. One scan of a project with Vertex AI and Memcache
// switched off spent 1,050 calls that way, 40% of all its API traffic, on five
// Get methods that could not have succeeded.
//
// The answer is memoized on the gcp.project resource (sync.Once around the
// enabled-services map), and gcp.project is itself cached by id, so this costs
// at most one ServiceUsage call per project no matter how many inits ask.
// CreateResource is used rather than NewResource deliberately: it skips
// initGcpProject, so asking the question never triggers a project fetch.
//
// A resolution failure is returned rather than folded into false, for the same
// reason resolveEnabled does it: reporting "not enabled" for a project that was
// never successfully checked would turn an unknown into a confident wrong answer.
