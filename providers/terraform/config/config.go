A directory is read the way Terraform itself reads it: the .tf, .tf.json,
.tfvars and .tfvars.json files. Any .tofu-flavored file sitting next to them is
skipped, because Terraform never applies it. Use the opentofu connector for
those.

Available commands:
  plan                       Terraform plan file
  state                      Terraform state file

Examples:
  cnspec shell terraform <PATH-TO-HCL-DIRECTORY>
  cnspec scan terraform <PATH-TO-HCL-FILE>
  cnspec scan terraform plan <PATH-TO-PLAN-JSON>
  cnspec scan terraform state <PATH-TO-STATE-JSON>

A directory is read the way OpenTofu itself reads it. Where a .tofu-flavored
file shares a name with its Terraform equivalent, the .tofu file wins and the
.tf file is not read: main.tofu replaces main.tf, and .tofu.json, .tofuvars and
.tofuvars.json replace their .tf equivalents in the same way. Files with no
.tofu counterpart are read as they are, so a configuration that has not been
renamed is queried unchanged.

Plan and state files carry no marker of their own -- their JSON is identical
between the two tools -- so the connector is what says which tool produced them.
It selects the platform the asset is reported under; the file is read the same
way either way.

Available commands:
  plan                       OpenTofu plan file
  state                      OpenTofu state file

Examples:
  cnspec shell opentofu <PATH-TO-HCL-DIRECTORY>
  cnspec scan opentofu <PATH-TO-HCL-FILE>
  cnspec scan opentofu plan <PATH-TO-PLAN-JSON>
  cnspec scan opentofu state <PATH-TO-STATE-JSON>
