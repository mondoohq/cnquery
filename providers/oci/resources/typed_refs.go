// A resource that points at another one - an instance at its image, a key at
// its vault - stores the target's OCID and resolves it on read. Every such
// accessor is the same six steps, and there were thirteen copies of them: five
// named helpers and eight written out inline.
//
// Two of those steps are easy to get wrong in a way nothing catches:
//
//   - The null marking. A singular resource accessor that returns (nil, nil)
//     without first setting StateIsNull leaves the runtime unable to tell the
//     field was resolved, so it re-fetches or panics on read rather than
//     reporting null. It has to happen on every empty-id path, in every copy.
//   - The type assertion. All thirteen ended in a bare res.(*mqlOciX), which
//     panics if the resource name and the target type ever disagree - and a
//     panic inside an accessor takes down the whole scan, not one field.
//
// resolveRef does both once.

// ociCompartmentRef carries a resource's raw compartment OCID. The OCID is not
// part of the schema, so it rides on the internal struct and feeds only the
// compartment() accessor and asset discovery. Every resource exposing
// compartment() embeds this through its mqlOci<Resource>Internal struct.
