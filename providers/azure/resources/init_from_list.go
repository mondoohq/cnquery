//
// Every discovered asset resolves its own resource through its init, once per
// asset, so a per-resource Get costs one API call per asset of that type: a
// subscription with 150 VMs pays 150 of them. The service's list is a single
// call that already contains every one of those resources, and during a scan it
// has usually been fetched already, because discovery itself walks the same
// list to find the assets. Worse, NewResource runs the init *before* it
// consults the resource cache, so a Get here is spent even when the resource is
// already built, and its result is then thrown away in favour of the cached
// one.
//
// This mirrors the k8s provider's initNamespacedResource.
//
// The trade is deliberate: resolving a single asset in isolation now pulls the
// whole subscription's list rather than one record. During a scan that list is
// wanted anyway and is very likely already cached; for a one-off query against
// one asset it is the more expensive path.
