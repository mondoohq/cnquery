// Nearly every list accessor in this provider walks an ARM pager and turns each
// row into an MQL resource. Written out per call site, that loop is about
// fifteen lines of scaffolding around two lines of service-specific logic -- and
// four of the things it does are decisions rather than mechanism: how long a
// call may take, what a denied read reports, what a truncated walk reports, and
// whether a nil row is dropped or dereferenced. Made independently a few hundred
// times, those decisions drift, and the drift is invisible because nothing
// fails: the list still has a length, the rows are just wrong or absent.
//
// listPaged makes them once. What is left at each call site is the pager and a
// mapping function, which is the part that actually differs between services --
// and, being pure, the part that can be tested without a subscription.

// listPagerTimeout bounds a single page fetch.
//
// The plugin API gives an accessor no context to inherit, so there is nothing to
// propagate a cancelled scan from; the best available is to make sure no single
// call can hang forever. The bound is per page rather than per walk so that a
// large collection is not cut off partway through merely for being large.
//
// Matches armHTTPTimeout in arm_paging.go, which bounds the hand-rolled requests
// for the same reason.

	// claim that there is nothing there, and a policy written as
	// `things.none(insecure)` passes on it. Reported for a read that was
	// refused, that is a silent pass on an unexamined subscription.
