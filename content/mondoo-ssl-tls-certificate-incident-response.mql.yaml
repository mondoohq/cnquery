        ### Overview

        The SSL/TLS Certificate Incident Response Pack by Mondoo query pack retrieves information about SSL/TLS certificates of a domain for investigation during a security incident.

        ### Prerequisites

        To run this query pack, you will need to install the cnquery binary ([Get Started with cnquery](https://mondoo.com/docs/cnquery/)).

        ### Run query pack

        To run this query pack against a Domain:

        ```bash
        cnquery scan host <domain> -f mondoo-ssl-tls-certificate-incident-response.mql.yaml
        ```
    filters:
      - asset.family.contains('network')
