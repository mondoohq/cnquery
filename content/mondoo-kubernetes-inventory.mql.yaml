        The Kubernetes Inventory Pack by Mondoo retrieves data about a Kubernetes Cluster for asset inventory.

        To run this pack for a Kubernetes Cluster:

        ```bash
        cnquery scan k8s -f mondoo-kubernetes-inventory.mql.yaml
        ```

        ## Join the community!
        Our goal is to build query packs that are simple to deploy and provide accurate and useful data.

        If you have any suggestions for improving this query pack, or if you need support, [join the Mondoo community](https://github.com/orgs/mondoohq/discussions) in GitHub Discussions.
