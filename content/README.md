# cnquery Query Packs

Query packs are pre-built collections of queries written in [MQL (Mondoo Query Language)](https://mondoo.com/docs/mql/home/) that help you gather information from your infrastructure for asset inventory, incident response, and security assessments. These packs are designed to work with cnquery, the open-source, cloud-native tool that answers every question about your infrastructure.

## What are Query Packs?

Query packs contain structured queries that:

- **Inventory assets** across cloud providers, operating systems, and applications
- **Support incident response** by gathering critical system information
- **Assess security posture** through targeted data collection
- **Standardize data gathering** across different platforms and environments

Each query pack is tailored for specific platforms and use cases, making it easy to get started with infrastructure assessment without writing queries from scratch.

## Usage

### Basic Usage

Run a query pack against your infrastructure:

```bash
cnquery scan -f mondoo-aws-inventory.mql.yaml
```

### Target Specific Assets

Run against specific targets:

```bash
# Local system
cnquery scan local -f mondoo-linux-inventory.mql.yaml

# Remote SSH
cnquery scan ssh user@hostname -f mondoo-linux-incident-response.mql.yaml

# AWS account
cnquery scan aws -f mondoo-aws-inventory.mql.yaml

# Kubernetes cluster
cnquery scan k8s -f mondoo-kubernetes-inventory.mql.yaml
```

### Output Formats

Export results in different formats:

```bash
# JSON output
cnquery scan -f mondoo-aws-inventory.mql.yaml --output json

# YAML output
cnquery scan -f mondoo-aws-inventory.mql.yaml --output yaml

# Compact output
cnquery scan -f mondoo-aws-inventory.mql.yaml --output compact
```

## Query Pack Structure

Each query pack is a YAML file that contains:

- **Metadata**: Name, version, author, and licensing information
- **Platform filters**: Automatic targeting based on asset type
- **Queries**: MQL queries organized by purpose
- **Documentation**: Descriptions and usage guidance

Example structure:

```yaml
packs:
  - uid: example-pack
    name: Example Query Pack
    version: 1.0.0
    queries:
      - uid: example-query
        title: Example Query
        mql: asset.name
```

## Creating Custom Query Packs

1. **Start with an existing pack** as a template
2. **Define your queries** using MQL syntax
3. **Add appropriate filters** for target platforms
4. **Test thoroughly** across your target environments
5. **Document your pack** with clear descriptions

For MQL syntax and available resources, see the [MQL documentation](https://mondoo.com/docs/mql/home/).
