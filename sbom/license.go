// It returns nil when there is nothing to record. An entry naming no license
// asserts a licensing fact the producer does not have, and is worse than an
// absent one: a consumer cannot tell it apart from a real determination.
//
// Which of the three mutually exclusive value fields gets set is decided by
// what the string actually is, using the same rule the CycloneDX renderer
// applies to the legacy scalar — one decision in one place, so the model and
// the rendering of it cannot disagree about whether "MIT OR Apache-2.0" is an
// identifier.
//
// Confidence is 1.0 and not a parameter. A declared license is a statement the
// package made about itself rather than a measurement somebody took of it, so
// there is nothing to be less than certain about. A concluded license — which
// carries its match score — is produced by whatever did the concluding, not
// here.

// made it arrived at, and location records the file the value was read from.
//
// confidence is clamped into (0,1]. A conclusion nothing was confident about is
// not evidence of anything, and a score above 1 is a producer bug rather than
// certainty; either would be read as a real measurement by a consumer ranking
// conclusions against each other. A zero or absent score becomes 1.0, which is
// what an entry with no score attached already means to a reader.

// Returns nil when the value states no license, for the reason DeclaredLicense
// does: an entry naming none asserts a fact the producer does not have.
