// TestPrinterDriversInSbom covers Windows print drivers reaching the SBOM.
//
// The fixture is captured verbatim from a real scan of a Windows 11 Pro host
// (platform windows 26200), not hand-written -- including the packed
// DriverVersion unpacked to a dotted quad, which is how 2814751477605035
// becomes 10.0.26100.8875.
//
// The load-bearing detail is the JSON key. BomFields is populated from the
// compiled datapoint label, and for a list resource that label is
// "<resource>.list" -- windows.printerDrivers.list, the same shape as
// packages.list and npm.packages.list. Getting it wrong fails silently: the
// field simply stays empty and the drivers never appear, with no error
// anywhere. The fixture therefore carries the verbatim key, so this test fails
// if the label convention or the tag ever drift apart.
