// TestPrinterDriversInSbom covers Windows print drivers reaching the SBOM.
//
// The load-bearing detail is the JSON key. BomFields is populated from the
// compiled datapoint label, and for a list resource that label is
// "<resource>.list" -- windows.printerDrivers.list, the same shape as
// packages.list and npm.packages.list. Getting it wrong fails silently: the
// field simply stays empty and the drivers never appear, with no error
// anywhere. The fixture therefore carries the verbatim key, so this test fails
// if the label convention or the tag ever drift apart.
