Description: collection of partitioning utilities
 This package contains the classic fdisk, sfdisk and cfdisk partitioning
 utilities from the util-linux suite.
 .
 The utilities included in this package allow you to partition
 your hard disk. The utilities supports both modern and legacy
 partition tables (eg. GPT, MBR, etc).
 .
 The fdisk utility is the classical text-mode utility.
 The cfdisk utilitity gives a more userfriendly curses based interface.
 The sfdisk utility is mostly for automation and scripting uses.
Important: yes

Description: package management runtime library
 This library provides the common functionality for searching and
 managing packages as well as information about packages.
 Higher-level package managers can depend upon this library.
 .
 This includes:
  * retrieval of information about packages from multiple sources
  * retrieval of packages and all dependent packages
    needed to satisfy a request either through an internal
    solver or by interfacing with an external one
  * authenticating the sources and validating the retrieved data
  * installation and removal of packages in the system
  * providing different transports to retrieve data over cdrom, ftp,
    http(s), rsh as well as an interface to add more transports like
    tor+http(s) (apt-transport-tor).

Description: Unicode string library for C
 The 'libunistring' library implements Unicode strings (in the UTF-8,
 UTF-16, and UTF-32 encodings), together with functions for Unicode
 characters (character names, classifications, properties) and
 functions for string processing (formatted output, width, word
 breaks, line breaks, normalization, case folding, regular
 expressions).
 .
 This package contains the shared library.

Version: 3.4-1

Description: low level cryptographic library (symmetric and one-way cryptos)
 Nettle is a cryptographic library that is designed to fit easily in more or
 less any context: In crypto toolkits for object-oriented languages (C++,
 Python, Pike, ...), in applications like LSH or GNUPG, or even in kernel
 space.
 .
 It tries to solve a problem of providing a common set of cryptographic
 algorithms for higher-level applications by implementing a
 context-independent set of cryptographic algorithms. In that light, Nettle
 doesn't do any memory allocation or I/O, it simply provides the
 cryptographic algorithms for the application to use in any environment and
 in any way it needs.
 .
 This package contains the symmetric and one-way cryptographic
 algorithms. To avoid having this package depend on libgmp, the
 asymmetric cryptos reside in a separate library, libhogweed.
