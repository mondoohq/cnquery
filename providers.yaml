# Configure builtin providers for the dev environment.
# This only covers additional builtin providers, ie those
# that are normally not builtin. Things like `core` are
# always builtin.
#
# Builtin providers are great testing. Example: if you
# review a PR where someone changed the `os` provider,
# you'll want to set it as builtin for fast testing.
# In this case it will be pulled from your local repo
# instead of using the pre-installed provider in 
# your OS (like ~/.mondoo/providers/os).
#
# If you want to test a provider that is not part of
# the cnquery repo, you can add it here as well.
# Example:
# - name: my-awesome-provider
#   remote: ~/path/to/my-awesome-provider
#   goPackage: github.com/me/my-awesome-provider
builtin: []
