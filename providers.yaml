# Configure builtin providers for the dev environment.
# This only covers additional builtin providers, ie those
# that are normally not builtin. Things like `core` are
# always builtin.
#
# Builtin providers are great testing. Example: if you
# review a PR where someone changed the `os` provider,
# you'll want to set it as builtin for fast testing.
# In this case it will be pulled from your local repo
# instead of using the pre-installed provider in 
# your OS (like ~/.mondoo/providers/os).
builtin: [os]
