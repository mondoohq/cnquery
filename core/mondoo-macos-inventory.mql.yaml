        The macOS Inventory Pack by Mondoo is designed to retrieve data about macOS hosts for asset inventory. 

        ## Local scan
        To run this pack locally on a macOS host:

        ```bash
        cnquery scan local -f mondoo-macos-inventory.mql.yaml
        ```

        ## Remote scan
        To run this pack against a remote macOS host using SSH (requires Remote Management is activated in System Preferences):

        ```bash
        cnquery scan ssh <user>@<ip_address> -i <identity_file> -f mondoo-macos-inventory.mql.yaml
        ```
