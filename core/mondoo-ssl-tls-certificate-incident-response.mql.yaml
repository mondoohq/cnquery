        ### Overview

        The SSL/TLS Certificate Incident Response Pack by Mondoo query pack gathers information about SSL/TLS certificates of a domain for investigation during a security incident.

        ### Prerequisites

        To run this query pack, you will need to install the cnquery binary ([Get Started with cnquery](https://mondoo.com/docs/cnquery/)).

        ### Run query pack

        To run this query pack against a Domain:

        ```bash
        cnquery scan host <domain> -f mondoo-ssl-tls-certificate-incident-response.mql.yaml
        ```
    filters:
      - asset.family.contains('network')
    queries:
      - uid: mondoo-ssl-tls-certificate-incident-response-domain-name
        title: Retreive Domain Name
        query: |
          tls.domainName
      - uid: mondoo-ssl-tls-certificate-incident-response-versions
        title: Retrieve list of supported SSL and TLS versions
        query: |

      - uid: mondoo-ssl-tls-certificate-incident-response-signing-algo
        title: Retrieve information about signature algorithm of all certificates in the certificate chain
        query: |
          tls.certificates {
            signingAlgorithm
            subject.commonName
          }
      - uid: mondoo-ssl-tls-certificate-incident-response-is-revoked
        title: Retrieve information about revoked, verified and CA status of all certificates in the certificate chain
