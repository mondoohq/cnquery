        ### Overview

        The Mondoo GitHub Organization Incident Response query pack gathers configuration data about GitHub Organizations and the repositories within for investigation during a security incident.

        ### Prerequisites

        To run this query pack, you will need a [GitHub personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token) with read access to the GitHub organization you are scanning.

        ### Run query pack

        To run this query pack against a GitHub Organization:

        ```bash
        export GITHUB_TOKEN=<your personal access token>
        cnquery scan github org <org_name> -f mondoo-github-org-incident-response.mql.yaml
        ```
