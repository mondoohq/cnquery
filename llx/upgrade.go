// The other direction: an old bundle meeting a newer reader (ADR 040 part 6).
//
// A bundle compiled before a change carries no translation for it - the
// producer had nothing to say about a future it had not seen. So the reader
// adapts, which it can do because it is the newer side and its own provider
// ships the catalog.
//
// Detection is a type comparison the reader can already make: the writer's type
// is baked into every field chunk by the compiler, and the reader's type is in
// its schema. When they disagree, the bundle was compiled against a different
// shape of that field, and every chunk downstream of it is compiled expecting
// the writer's shape.
//
// This is the failure that has no symptom otherwise. A missing name errors; a
// changed type does not - the field resolves, returns the reader's shape, and
// the query either fails somewhere unrelated ("cannot find function '=='") or
// silently produces a plausible wrong answer.

// TypeDrift is one field whose type differs between the bundle and the reader.

// FindTypeDrift reports every field chunk whose declared type disagrees with the
// reader's schema.
//
// It is the detection half on its own. Repairing a drift needs the inverse of
// the provider's translation for that change, which is why this returns
// findings rather than patching: knowing `[]string` is not `string` says nothing
// about which element to take, and only the provider that made the change can
// say whether there is an answer at all.
