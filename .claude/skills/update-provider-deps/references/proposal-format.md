# Proposing what to add

Read during Phase 6. The output of this phase is a numbered list the user picks from, not
an implementation.

## Why numbered and ranked

An SDK major typically exposes far more than anyone wants to build. Handing over an
unranked pile moves the sorting work onto the user; implementing your own favourites
without asking spends their review budget on your priorities. A ranked list with honest
effort estimates lets them say "1, 2, and 6" in one line.

## Gather

Two passes, because their costs differ by an order of magnitude.

**Tier A — new fields on types the provider already uses.** Cheapest possible schema
growth: the resource exists, the API call already happens, and often the value is already
in a response being parsed.

```bash
python3 $P/structdiff.py "$OLD" "$NEW" --types-from providers/<name>
```

Read the `+` lines. Ignore parser noise (a field whose type reads like an English word is a
misparsed comment).

**Tier B — services the SDK gained.** Needs a lister, an `__id` scheme, error handling, and
schema review.

```bash
python3 $P/structdiff.py "$OLD" "$NEW" | head -80     # NEW TYPES section
```

The client struct's own diff is the most reliable signal here: a new service accessor on
the top-level client is a whole API area. Cross-check against the release notes, which
usually name new services explicitly.

## Filter before listing

Every candidate must survive three checks. Doing this before presenting keeps the list
trustworthy:

1. **Not already exposed.** `grep -i '<fieldname>' providers/<name>/resources/*.lr`. Check
   the *resource* too — a name may exist on a different resource than the one you mean.
2. **Real data.** See "Before you add anything" in `schema-additions.md`. A field gated
   behind a request flag we don't set is not a candidate.
3. **Actually readable.** A service with only create/update/delete methods cannot back a
   read-only resource. GitLab's security-attributes service is exactly this: attractive in
   the diff, unbuildable without dropping to GraphQL.

Say so when something interesting fails these checks — "considered and rejected because"
is useful information, and it stops the same candidate being re-proposed next time.

## Rank

Order by **audit value per unit of effort**, not by size.

Audit value is highest for things that answer a question a policy would ask and currently
cannot: an unset webhook secret, a trigger that starts code from an external location, an
agent with standing access to data, a backup that dies with its cluster. Capability and
cost flags rank lower. "Would a security policy read this?" is the discriminator.

Effort is roughly: **S** = fields on an existing resource, no new call. **M** = a new
resource over one list endpoint, or fields needing a new call. **L** = a service with
sub-resources, pagination, and its own error semantics.

Keep the tiers visually separate so the user can take all of Tier A cheaply without
implicitly signing up for Tier B.

## Format

```markdown
### Tier A — new fields on existing resources

1. **<provider> · <short title>** [S]
   <One or two sentences: what it reports and which question it answers.>
   Fields: `fieldOne`, `fieldTwo`, `fieldThree`

2. ...

### Tier B — new resources

7. **<provider> · <short title>** [M]
   <What the service is and why it is worth modelling.>
   API: `ListThings` / `GetThing`

### Considered and rejected

- **<thing>** — <why: already exposed / stub data / no read method>
```

Then ask which numbers they want, and wait. Don't start implementing the obvious ones while
waiting — the point of the phase is that the choice is theirs.

## After they choose

Confirm the selection back in one line, then implement per `schema-additions.md`. If a
chosen item turns out to be unbuildable once you're in the code, say so and stop rather
than substituting something else.
