# modfetch.sh <module-path> <version>  ->  extracts the module and prints its directory
#
# Fetches the module zip straight from proxy.golang.org and unpacks it. Going to the
# proxy rather than through `go mod download` matters for two reasons: it needs no
# module context (so you can fetch a version the tree does not depend on, which is the
# whole point when diffing old against new), and it uses curl, which trusts the system
# keychain. The Go toolchain does not, so inside the sandbox it fails on the proxy's
# intercepted TLS with `x509: OSStatus -26276` while curl sails through.
#
# Extractions land outside the repo so they never show up in `git status`. Override
# with SDKDIFF_DIR if you want them somewhere specific.
