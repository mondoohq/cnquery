"""Probe (and optionally apply) SDK upgrades for mql providers.

Why this exists: `go get path@latest` only finds bumps within the *current* major (it
won't discover that the dep is now published at `path/v3`). For Azure SDK Go, OCI, and
the MongoDB Atlas date-stamped majors in particular, new majors live at a new path and
require import-path rewrites. This script probes proxy.golang.org for higher-major
paths, applies them across the source tree, and runs `go mod tidy && go build`.

Run it from the mql root. Paths below assume the skill directory:

  P=.claude/skills/update-provider-deps/probe.py

  python3 $P                            # probe every known provider's go.mod
  python3 $P --provider=aws,oci         # only these (providers/aws, providers/oci)
  python3 $P --provider=github --apply  # ...and upgrade them
  python3 $P --list                     # every known provider and the prefixes it scans
  python3 $P --json                     # machine-readable rows, for scripted follow-up
  python3 $P --root /path/to/mql        # locate providers/<name>/go.mod under this root
  python3 $P <path/to/go.mod>           # single-file mode: probe one go.mod
  python3 $P <path/to/go.mod> --provider=azure --apply   # ...scanned for those prefixes

Single-file mode is the escape hatch for a provider that is not in the table below
(a DB driver, a network device client): point it at that provider's go.mod directly.

When no go.mod path is given, each requested provider maps to
<root>/providers/<name>/go.mod; with no --provider, every known provider is processed.

Newest is not always correct. A provider SDK is a client for a server the customer runs, so
the version to target is the oldest one within the major that still covers our feature set --
a newer client can demand a newer server. This script cannot reason about that, so any
provider whose SDK version is constrained by server compatibility is kept out of the table
below and updated by hand. See the `nutanix` note in PROVIDER_PREFIXES.

Output legend (probe mode):
  UP   <path>@<old> -> <newpath>@<new>     stable upgrade available
  OK   <path>@<ver>                        already on latest stable major
  BETA <path>@<ver>                        new major exists only as beta/pseudo

BETA rows are reported and never applied. A new major that has only ever shipped as
beta churns its API for months before GA, and adopting one means re-doing the migration
when it stabilizes. Surface them to the user as a separate list rather than folding them
into the upgrade set.

# Each cloud is matched by one or more module path prefixes. The probe logic is identical
# across clouds; the prefixes just decide which deps to scan. A key must equal the mql
# provider's directory name, since discovery mode resolves it to providers/<key>/go.mod.
#
# Only providers that vendor a real platform SDK are listed. Providers that talk to their
# API over hand-rolled HTTP (vercel, netlify, neon, nextdns, proxmox, clickhousecloud,
# mistral, huggingface, vllm, grafana, iru) have nothing to probe. Deliberately out of
# scope: DB drivers (mysqldb, postgresdb, redisdb, mssql, cassandra, clickhousedb),
# network/hardware (arista, mikrotik, redfish, ipmi, opcua, nmap) and IaC tooling
# (terraform, helm, kustomize, cloudformation, ansible) — pass their go.mod in
# single-file mode if you ever want them.
#
# nutanix is EXCLUDED ON PURPOSE — do not add it back. Its SDK version is dictated by the
# Prism Central release the customer runs, not by what is newest: the v4.1+ clients request
# /api/<svc>/v4.2/... paths that GA Prism Central answers with 404, which breaks every
# non-IAM resource (customer issue #222, PR #8917). providers/nutanix/go.mod holds the
# require lines at v4.0.x with `// pin` markers and backs them with replace directives;
# this script reads neither, so pointing it at that file only desynchronizes the two.
# Nutanix bumps are a manual change, gated on the minimum supported Prism Central.
