"""structdiff.py <old_dir> <new_dir> [--types-from <provider_dir>]

Diff the struct fields of two extracted SDK versions. This answers both halves of an
upgrade at once: fields that appeared are candidate schema additions, fields that were
removed or retyped are breaking changes the release notes may not mention.

Point it at directories produced by modfetch.sh:

    OLD=$(./modfetch.sh github.com/cloudflare/cloudflare-go/v6 v6.10.0)
    NEW=$(./modfetch.sh github.com/cloudflare/cloudflare-go/v7 v7.8.0)
    python3 structdiff.py "$OLD" "$NEW" --types-from providers/cloudflare

--types-from is what makes the output usable. An SDK diff across a major runs to tens of
thousands of lines, nearly all of it types the provider has never touched. Restricting to
types the provider source actually mentions turns that into a page you can read, and it
is exactly the right filter for the two questions being asked: what can we expose on
resources we already ship, and what did we break.

Drop --types-from to see NEW TYPES as well, which is how you spot whole services the SDK
gained. That list is long and mostly noise, so read it after the restricted pass.

Two limits worth knowing before trusting the output:

  * Parsing is line-oriented rather than a real Go parse. Field *names* are reliable;
    a comment line that begins with a capitalized word can be misread as a field, so
    exotic-looking types (`UUID:of`, `Indicates:whether`) are parser noise, not schema.
  * Types are keyed by bare name across the whole module. In a multi-package SDK such as
    google.golang.org/api or cloudflare-go, generic names like `User`, `Identity` and
    `Schedule` exist in several packages and get merged into one entry. Treat those
    results as indicative and confirm against the package you actually import.
