# Add Staged Discovery to a Provider

Implement staged (multi-phase) discovery for a provider so that `AssetExplorer` can traverse the provider's resource hierarchy one level at a time, releasing memory after each scope is closed.

**Background:** See `docs/adr/002-staged-discovery.md` for the full design rationale and `docs/adr/001-asset-explorer-lazy-discovery.md` for how `AssetExplorer` drives the traversal.

**Reference implementation:** The K8s provider in `providers/k8s/resources/discovery.go` — study `Discover()`, `discoverClusterStage()`, and `discoverNamespaceStage()` as the canonical example.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, understand the provider's resource hierarchy. Every provider has a natural tree:
- **K8s:** cluster → namespaces → workloads (pods, deployments, etc.)
- **GCP:** organization → projects → services → resources
- **AWS:** organization → accounts → regions → resources
- **Azure:** tenant → subscriptions → resource groups → resources

Each level of this tree becomes a discovery stage. Ask the user to confirm the hierarchy if it's not obvious.

## Step-by-Step Implementation

### Step 1: Identify the discovery entry point

Find the provider's `Discover()` function. It is typically in `providers/<name>/resources/discovery.go` or called from `providers/<name>/provider/provider.go` during connection setup.

```bash
# Find the discovery function
grep -rn "func.*Discover" providers/<name>/resources/ providers/<name>/provider/
```

Read the existing discovery logic thoroughly. Understand:
- What assets are currently returned (the full set)
- How platform IDs are constructed
- How connection configs are set on child assets
- Whether `WithParentConnectionId` is used and where

### Step 2: Add the staged discovery router

Modify the `Discover()` function to check for `OptionStagedDiscovery` and route to stage-specific functions. The legacy path MUST remain unchanged — older clients that don't set the flag must continue working.

```go
import "go.mondoo.com/mql/v13/providers-sdk/v1/plugin"

func Discover(runtime *plugin.Runtime, ...) (*inventory.Inventory, error) {
    conn := runtime.Connection.(YourConnection)
    invConfig := conn.InventoryConfig()

    if _, ok := invConfig.Options[plugin.OptionStagedDiscovery]; ok {
        // Route based on which stage we're in.
        // Use a provider-specific option to determine the current scope.
        if invConfig.Options["your-scope-option"] != "" {
            return discoverScopedStage(runtime, conn, invConfig)
        }
        return discoverRootStage(runtime, conn, invConfig)
    }

    // Legacy single-pass discovery — DO NOT MODIFY
    // TODO(v15): remove this once all clients use staged discovery
    return discoverLegacy(runtime, conn, invConfig)
}
```

**Important:** Rename the existing discovery function to `discoverLegacy` (or similar) and add a `TODO(v15)` comment. Do not delete it.

### Step 3: Implement Stage 1 (root/top-level scope)

Stage 1 discovers the top-level asset and its immediate children. Children are returned as assets with connection configs that trigger Stage 2 when connected.

**Critical rules:**
- Child assets that represent a new scope (e.g., namespaces, projects, regions) must NOT use `WithParentConnectionId`. They need their own independent runtime so their MQL resource cache is isolated and released when the scope is closed.
- Clone the parent's connection config for each child, adding a scope option that identifies the next stage.
- The `OptionStagedDiscovery` flag is propagated automatically by `Clone()`.

```go
func discoverRootStage(runtime *plugin.Runtime, conn YourConnection, invConfig *inventory.Config) (*inventory.Inventory, error) {
    in := &inventory.Inventory{Spec: &inventory.InventorySpec{
        Assets: []*inventory.Asset{},
    }}

    // 1. Discover the root asset itself (with platform IDs)
    rootAsset := &inventory.Asset{
        PlatformIds: []string{rootPlatformId},
        Name:        conn.Name(),
        Platform:    conn.Platform(),
        Connections: []*inventory.Config{invConfig.Clone(inventory.WithoutDiscovery())},
    }
    in.Spec.Assets = append(in.Spec.Assets, rootAsset)

    // 2. Discover child scopes (e.g., projects, namespaces, regions)
    children, err := listChildScopes(conn)
    if err != nil {
        return nil, err
    }

    for _, child := range children {
        // Clone WITHOUT WithParentConnectionId — each child gets its own
        // runtime and MQL resource cache, released when the child is closed.
        childConfig := invConfig.Clone()
        childConfig.Options["your-scope-option"] = child.ID

        childAsset := &inventory.Asset{
            PlatformIds: []string{child.PlatformId},
            Name:        child.Name,
            Platform:    child.Platform,
            Connections: []*inventory.Config{childConfig},
        }
        in.Spec.Assets = append(in.Spec.Assets, childAsset)
    }

    return in, nil
}
```

### Step 4: Implement Stage 2+ (scoped discovery)

Each subsequent stage reads its scope from the connection config, discovers resources within that scope, and optionally emits further children for deeper stages.

**Leaf assets within a scope SHOULD use `WithParentConnectionId`** to share the scope's API client cache. This avoids redundant API calls while keeping the cache scoped to the parent (not the root).

```go
func discoverScopedStage(runtime *plugin.Runtime, conn YourConnection, invConfig *inventory.Config) (*inventory.Inventory, error) {
    scopeId := invConfig.Options["your-scope-option"]

    in := &inventory.Inventory{Spec: &inventory.InventorySpec{
        Assets: []*inventory.Asset{},
    }}

    // Discover resources within this scope
    resources, err := listResourcesInScope(conn, scopeId)
    if err != nil {
        return nil, err
    }

    for _, res := range resources {
        resAsset := &inventory.Asset{
            PlatformIds: []string{res.PlatformId},
            Name:        res.Name,
            Platform:    res.Platform,
            // Leaf assets share the scope's API cache
            Connections: []*inventory.Config{invConfig.Clone(
                inventory.WithParentConnectionId(invConfig.Id),
            )},
        }
        in.Spec.Assets = append(in.Spec.Assets, resAsset)
    }

    return in, nil
}
```

### Step 5: Gate resource methods at higher scopes (if needed)

When the root scope is scanned, resource methods that load lower-scope data should return empty results to avoid loading everything into the root's cache. This is optional but important for large providers.

```go
func isRootScopedConnection(r *plugin.Runtime) bool {
    conn := r.Connection.(YourConnection)
    cfg := conn.InventoryConfig()
    if _, ok := cfg.Options[plugin.OptionStagedDiscovery]; !ok {
        return false // Legacy path — don't gate anything
    }
    return cfg.Options["your-scope-option"] == "" // Root scope = no child scope set
}

// In a resource method that should only run at child scope:
func (r *mqlYourProvider) childScopedResources() ([]interface{}, error) {
    if isRootScopedConnection(r.MqlRuntime) {
        return []interface{}{}, nil // Empty at root scope — will be loaded per child
    }
    // ... normal implementation
}
```

### Step 6: Verify both paths produce the same assets

Both the legacy and staged paths must discover the same final set of assets (same platform IDs, same names). They differ only in how discovery is chunked.

```bash
# Build and install
make providers/build/<name> && make providers/install/<name>

# Test legacy path (no staged discovery flag — simulates old client)
# This should work exactly as before
mql shell <provider-args>

# Test staged path (AssetExplorer sets the flag automatically)
# Verify the same assets appear
mql shell <provider-args>

# Run existing tests
go test ./providers/<name>/...
```

### Step 7: Update .lr.versions if new resources were added

If you added any new resources or fields to support staged discovery, update the `.lr.versions` file:

```bash
make providers/mqlr
./mqlr generate providers/<name>/resources/<name>.lr --dist providers/<name>/resources
```
