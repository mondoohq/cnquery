# Sorts a provider's resource init functions by whether they call the API.

# Output: <bucket>\t<file>:<line>\t<func>
#
#   ARGS-ONLY  fills args and returns; no I/O. Fine as-is.
#   FROM-LIST  reads a parent resource's list accessor. The target state.
#   API-CALL   builds a client and fetches one resource itself. Candidate for
#              migration -- costs one call per asset of that type.
#   API+LIST   does both; read it by hand, it is usually a partial migration.
#
# BLIND SPOT: this reads init functions only. A typed-reference accessor that
# builds a client and fetches inline never calls NewResource, never enters an
# init, and so does not appear here at all -- in azure that is 43 accessors
# against 126 that go through NewResource. An audit that runs only this script
# will look complete while missing them. Enumerate them with the companion
# script, classify-accessors.awk, and split the result by fan-in: most are
# owned sub-objects with exactly one parent and nothing to dedupe.
#
# The buckets are a triage heuristic, not a verdict: confirm by reading the
# function before migrating it. In particular, an API-CALL init that is not a
# discovery target is reached through typed accessors rather than once per
# asset, so it is much cheaper than one that is.
