# Deduplicating provider API calls

## Overview

Two pieces of shared mql machinery decide how many times a provider asks the
same question. Both fail quietly: the scan still returns correct data, it just
costs N times more calls than it needs, and the redundancy is what provokes
throttling.

**Mechanism 1 — the resource cache is per connection.** `providers.Coordinator`
gives every discovered asset its own `Runtime`, and MQL resource values live in
`runtime.Resources`. Unless a provider says otherwise, nothing is shared: data
that belongs to a subscription / project / account is re-fetched once per asset
beneath it. See *The parent-child cache model* below.

**Mechanism 2 — `init` runs before the cache is read.** In the generated
`<provider>.lr.go`, `NewResource` calls `f.Init(runtime, args)` and only *then*
checks `runtime.Resources.Get(id)`. An init that performs I/O therefore spends
its call once per asset, and on a cache hit its freshly built resource is thrown
away in favour of the cached one.

It has to be this way in general: the cache key is the resolved resource's
`MqlID()`, which for a resource whose identity is computed during init is not
knowable beforehand. The opening exists only for callers that already supply
the id — see *cache-first* in Phase 4.

**A third class, and usually the biggest: calls that can never succeed.** Not
duplicates of a useful call but lookups made with an identifier belonging to
some other resource, because an init adopted the scanned asset's identity
without checking what the asset was. It is not a caching problem and none of
the phases below address it. It is also cheaper to find and worth more —
26.7% of one provider's traffic against the 5% the caching work recovered — so
check it first. See *Check this first* below.

**A fourth class, which none of the analysis below can find: work repeated per
asset in the connection lifecycle.** Not an init, not an accessor, not the
resource cache — something a provider redoes every time it builds a connection
or a client for another asset. In three of five providers audited this was the
single largest source of waste, and in every one of those the static passes came
back clean. See *The class the classifiers cannot see*.

**Worked examples, with numbers.** Eight providers have been through this work.
What each one's defect turned out to be, what the fix measured, and what the
test environment could *not* exercise are recorded per provider in
[`docs/provider-scan-performance.md`](../../../docs/provider-scan-performance.md).

Read it before starting a new provider. The third and fourth classes above were
discovered there rather than reasoned out, as was a fifth that no classifier
finds: **two different fields issuing one identical request**. No amount of cache
sharing fixes that one, because each field is computed correctly and exactly
once -- the duplication is below the resource layer, where only the URL is
visible. The per-provider notes say which class bit which provider, and the
*What is not covered* sections are the honest record of where each audit
stopped. It is also the precedent for how to report this work: every claim tied
to a measurement, and the one change that reduced calls without improving
wall-clock (vSphere) filed as a draft rather than sold as a win.

## The parent-child cache model

Worth understanding on its own, not just for init migration: it governs every
cross-asset reuse decision a provider makes.

A child asset opts in by carrying `ParentConnectionId` on its inventory config,
set at discovery time with `inventory.WithParentConnectionId(parentID)`. At
connect time `providers-sdk/v1/plugin/service.go` resolves the parent and does:

```go
runtime.Resources = parentRuntime.Resources   // the same map, not a copy
```

That one assignment has consequences well past list/get:

| Property | Consequence |
|---|---|
| It shares the **map object**, not a snapshot | Anything any asset resolves becomes visible to every sibling, in both directions, for the parent's lifetime |
| Reuse is per **resolved field**, not per call | A `sync.Once` on an Internal struct, a memoizer hung on a root resource, a lazily fetched sub-object — all of it is shared once the instance is |
| Identity is `resourceName + "\x00" + __id` | Sharing only pays when the `__id` is stable across assets. An `__id` that embeds the asset, or is empty, silently defeats it |
| Writes are shared too | Internal-struct caches must be safe for concurrent use once assets can be scanned in parallel |
| Lifetime is the **parent's** | Children look the parent up at connect time; if it is already closed they fall back to their own cache and `service.go` logs `parent connection not found`. Memory frees only when the parent closes |
| It is same-provider only | `runtime.go`'s `crossProviderAsset` clears the parent id before handing an asset to another provider |

**Choosing the scope is a correctness decision, not a performance knob.** Share
at the level the data belongs to. Share *above* it and resources that read their
scope from the connection answer for the wrong scope — silently, because a
wrong-but-present answer never errors. Share *below* it and nothing is reused.

**Three ways to share, picked by what the data is keyed on:**

| Pattern | Use when | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Parent connection id | Data belongs to a scope that has its own connection | aws, gcp, k8s, github discovery |
| Memoizer on a root MQL resource | Data is not attached to any one resource, but is scope-wide | github `mqlGithubInternal.memoize` for `getUser`/`getOrg` |
| Process-wide cache keyed by identity | Data outlives connections entirely and is keyed on credentials, not scope | azure `credentialCache`; `plugin.Service.Memoizer` |

The second only works if the first is in place — a memoizer on a root resource
is per resource cache, so without parenting it is per asset. Reach for the third
when there is no connection to hang the scope on.

### What already caches, and what it misses

Before concluding something is re-fetched, know which of the three existing
layers should have caught it. Two of them are easy to mistake for full coverage:

| Layer | Where | Covers |
|---|---|---|
| `GetData` cache check | `plugin/service.go` | The client asking for a field on a resource id already in the cache. No init runs. |
| `GetOrCompute` | `plugin/runtime.go` | A field memoized on the **referring instance**, so `nicA.subnet` computes once however often it is read |
| `NewResource` cache check | generated `<provider>.lr.go` | A resource whose init already ran — but only **after** that init has run and fetched |

What none of them covers: **a new referring instance resolving a reference for
the first time.** Thirty NICs on four subnets means thirty separate `Subnet`
fields, thirty `NewResource` calls, thirty inits, thirty fetches — for four
subnets. `GetOrCompute` does not help because each NIC has its own field;
`GetData` does not help because the provider is minting the reference rather
than being asked for a field on a known id.

## When to use

- A scan times out, or raising parallelism makes it worse rather than better
- Debug logs show the same request URL tens of times
- Adding a provider's resources to a scan multiplies API traffic
- Before shipping a new provider, as a design review of its inits and discovery

**Not for:** a provider that is genuinely slow because the API is slow, or one
that fetches too much per call. Measure first — this skill only removes
*repeats*.

## Check this first: calls that can never succeed

Before any caching work, check for a different and usually larger class of
waste: calls made with an identifier that does not belong to the resource being
asked for. These are not duplicates of a useful call, they are calls that
**cannot** return the requested thing. In the provider this skill came from they
were 26.7% of all API traffic, five times what the caching work recovered.

**The mechanism.** An init called with no args falls back to the scanned
asset's own identity:

```go
if len(args) == 0 {
    if assetArn := getAssetIdentifier(runtime); assetArn != "" {
        args["arn"] = llx.StringData(assetArn)   // whatever the asset happens to be
    }
}
```

That is correct when the asset *is* the resource, which is what it was written
for. It is wrong on every other asset, and every other asset is where it mostly
runs — because **cnspec evaluates every policy's filter against every asset** to
decide which policies apply, and filters routinely probe a bare resource instead
of checking the platform:

```
//policy.api.mondoo.app/filter/AdVyvxA8WWw=
  aws.secretsmanager.secret.lastChangedDate != null
```

So while an EC2 instance is scanned, that filter reaches the Secrets Manager
init, which adopts the *instance's* ARN and calls `DescribeSecret` with it.

**Why it stays invisible.** The call fails, failures are not cached, so it is
retried once per referrer — a single doomed lookup became 42 calls. A failed
init is not surfaced as a scan error, so nothing in the output says this is
happening. It is visible only in a request trace, and only if you compare the
*identifier* against the *API being called*.

**Why only some inits are expensive.** How much of the identifier the init
validates decides whether it pays. One that checks the resource type rejects a
foreign id for free:

```go
if parsed, err := arn.Parse(arnVal); err == nil && strings.HasPrefix(parsed.Resource, "snapshot/") {
```

One that only needs the region or subscription succeeds at parsing *any* id and
proceeds straight to the API. Those are the ones that bleed.

**Detect it.** Two signals, in order of preference:

*1. Response status, if the trace logs it.* A doomed lookup answers 404 or 400,
so non-2xx responses locate the bug directly and the method is
provider-agnostic. Azure's `apiTracePolicy` already logs `status`:

```bash
grep "azure api call" scan.log | grep -oE 'status=[0-9]+' | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn
# then read the URLs behind the failures
grep "azure api call" scan.log | grep -vE 'status=(2[0-9][0-9]|0)' |
  sed -E 's#.*url=([^ ]*).*#\1#' | sed -E 's#/subscriptions/[^/]+#/SUB#' | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn
```

Prefer this where available. Note a 404 is not proof on its own — some are
legitimate "this optional sub-resource does not exist" probes — so confirm by
checking whether the identifier in the URL names a *different* kind of resource
than the endpoint expects.

*2. Identifier-vs-endpoint comparison*, when status is not traced. Compare the
service named in the identifier with the service being called. Do it over
request bodies *and* URLs — REST-style services carry the id in the path,
query-protocol ones in the body, and checking only one hides half the problem
(in the source provider, one service was found only via bodies and another only
via URLs):

```bash
grep "api call" scan.log | sed -E 's/.*host=([^ ]*).*params=(.*)/\1\t\2/' |
awk -F'\t' '{ svc=$1; sub(/\..*/,"",svc)
  if (match($2, /arn:aws:[a-z0-9-]+/)) { split(substr($2,RSTART,RLENGTH),p,":")
    if (p[3] != svc) bad[svc" <- "p[3]]++ } }
END { for (k in bad) print bad[k], k }' | sort -rn
```

That snippet is ARN-shaped; the general form is "pull the resource-type token
out of the identifier and compare it to the endpoint's". For ARM ids the token
is the `Microsoft.X/type` segment of the path.

A uniform count across unrelated services is the giveaway either way — six
services each sitting at exactly 436 calls in a 169-asset scan is one doomed
call per asset, not real work.

**Fix by gating on the asset's platform, not by parsing the id.** The platform
is the exact discriminator: the provider's platform registry holds one entry per
discoverable object type, so it is a string equality test rather than a prefix
heuristic. Parsing the id invites two specific bugs — separators are not uniform
(`secret:name` but `key/id`), and providers mint synthetic ids whose service
field does not exist upstream (`arn:aws:vpc:` where AWS itself uses
`arn:aws:ec2:...:vpc/...`), so a guard written from the cloud's own docs breaks
those resources.

```go
func getAssetIdentifier(runtime *plugin.Runtime, platform string) string {
	...
	if a.Platform == nil || a.Platform.Name != platform {
		// the scanned asset is not this kind of resource, so its id is not ours
		return ""
	}
```

**Make the parameter required.** That is the whole point: the compiler then
forces every call site to declare a platform, so inits that are merely *latent*
get fixed too. In the source provider only 3 of 61 sites were actively bleeding;
the other 47 were one policy filter away from joining them. Do the same for any
sibling helper that hands back asset identity by name rather than id — that one
was calling `GetUser` with volume ids and log-group paths.

Two follow-ups worth doing at the same time:

- Inits whose resource is **never a standalone asset** can only ever adopt a
  foreign id. Delete the fallback rather than inventing a platform for it, and
  let the existing "id required" error fire.
- Export the platform names as constants and reference them. A mistyped platform
  matches no asset and **fails closed**, silently disabling asset-scoped
  resolution for that one resource with no error to notice. Lock it with a test
  asserting every platform passed is present in the registry.

**Verify with scores, not just call counts.** A guard that is too tight removes
calls *and* answers. Diff the per-check scores between runs and require zero
differences; in the source provider all 14,557 score tuples were byte-identical
while calls fell 80.8%, and the only change was 34 *fewer* "provider returned no
data and no error" warnings — the wreckage of resources the bug had fabricated.

## The class the classifiers cannot see

Phases 2 and 3 read init and accessor *shapes*. A provider can pass both
perfectly and still spend most of its calls re-doing per-asset work, because
that work lives in connection setup rather than in a resource. This has been the
biggest single finding in three of five providers audited. In two of them the
classifiers reported a clean sweep; in the third they reported work and a
too-hasty reading of it produced the wrong conclusion:

| provider | static audit | what a scan found |
|---|---|---|
| gcp | classifier flagged 17 API-CALL inits; reading a few, all resolving from lists, produced "this provider is immune" | 1,050 calls, 40% of traffic, from the 6 that did not |
| gitlab | 0 API-CALL inits, 0 INLINE accessors, no asset-identity adoption | 110 of 149 calls: discovery re-ran for every asset it produced |
| vsphere | 0 API-CALL inits, 0 INLINE accessors | 550 of 1,529 calls: an esxcli executor rebuilt per command |

None of those is an init or accessor defect. They are:

- a **discovery guard that never fired**, because `inventory.WithoutDiscovery()`
  clones a config with `Discover` set to an empty `&Discovery{}` rather than nil,
  and the provider checked the pointer instead of `Targets`
- a **client rebuilt per call** whose constructor itself costs round trips
- a **helper that resolves from a list for some resources and not others**, where
  reading a sample of the former is what produced the wrong conclusion

**The signature is arithmetic.** Divide total calls by asset count. If some URL
appears exactly once per asset, or the total is far above what the resource
count justifies, the waste is per-asset:

```bash
grep "api call" scan.log | sed -E 's/.*url=([^ ]+).*/\1/' | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | head
grep -c "scan complete asset" scan.log
```

`37 /groups/acme/subgroups` next to `assets=37` is the whole diagnosis.

**Then separate discovery from scanning.** Find the line number of the first
completed asset and count calls either side. Work that belongs to discovery but
appears after it has started scanning is being repeated per asset:

```bash
first=$(grep -n "scan complete asset" scan.log | head -1 | cut -d: -f1)
grep -n "api call" scan.log | cut -d: -f1 | awk -v f=$first '{if($1<f) b++; else a++} END{print "discovery:", b, " scanning:", a}'
```

**And read the log around one occurrence.** The per-asset sequence is usually
unmistakable once seen — a new runtime, then the same three setup calls:

```
DBG Started a new runtime (35 total)
DBG finding group id=5409231                        → GET /groups/5409231
DBG calling list subgroups with acme                → GET /groups/acme/subgroups
DBG calling list descendant groups with acme        → GET /groups/acme/descendant_groups
```

A provider with no API tracing cannot be audited this way at all. Adding a
round-tripper that logs method, path, status and duration is step one, not
optional — gitlab and vsphere both needed one before anything could be measured,
and ms365 still has none. Drop the query string: it carries pagination cursors
and sometimes tokens.

## Phase 1 — Measure before touching anything

Everything below is worthless without a before/after number. Providers log
their calls at debug (azure: `apiTracePolicy` in `connection/connection.go`); if
yours does not, add an equivalent per-call log line first.

```bash
mql run <provider> <scope-flags> --discover <target> -c "<query>" --log-level debug > before.log 2>&1

# total vs distinct, grouped by URL shape
grep "api call" before.log | sed -E 's/.*url=([^ ]+).*/\1/' \
  | sed -E 's#/resourceGroups/[^/]+/#/RG/#; s#/[^/]+$#/{name}#' \
  | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn
```

A/B against the released provider by moving your build aside and letting mql
reinstall the published one:

```bash
P=~/.config/mondoo/providers/<provider>
mv $P /tmp/mine && mql run ... > released.log 2>&1; rm -rf $P && mv /tmp/mine $P
```

**Four measurement traps that will fool you.** Each of these produced a wrong
conclusion in the work this skill came from:

| Trap | Guard |
|---|---|
| The binary under test is not yours — mql auto-updates providers, and A/B swaps leave the published build installed | Put a unique debug line in your build and `grep -c` it in every log before reading any number |
| Counting output lines instead of resolved values — a field that errors still prints a line | Count `field: "` (resolved) against `field: no data` separately |
| Trace logs usually strip the query string, so paginated list calls collapse onto one URL and read as duplication | Confirm a suspected duplicate is constant as asset count grows; if it is, it is pagination |
| **The probe never reaches the code you changed**, so before and after match and the fix reads as useless | A/B against a build with the change *neutered*. If neutered and real produce **identical** counts, suspect the probe, not the fix — then confirm the path by reading the accessor |

That last one is the expensive mistake. A typed reference may be resolved by an
accessor that fetches inline rather than through `NewResource`, in which case it
never enters the init and no init-level change can move its numbers. Verify the
path reaches your code before concluding anything from a flat A/B.

## Phase 2 — Classify every init

**A clean result here is not a conclusion, and neither is a sampled one.** Two of
five providers audited scored zero on every bucket and still had a large
per-asset defect. A third scored 17 API-CALL inits, of which a sample read as
harmless — the six not sampled were 40% of its traffic. Treat the classifiers as
a way to find *some* work, never as evidence there is none, and read every entry
they flag rather than enough to form an impression.


`classify-inits.awk` sorts a provider's init functions into three buckets:

```bash
awk -f .claude/skills/provider-api-call-dedup/classify-inits.awk providers/<name>/resources/*.go | sort
```

| Bucket | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `ARGS-ONLY` | Fills args, no I/O. Fine. |
| `FROM-LIST` | Resolves out of a parent list. The target state. |
| `API-CALL` | Fetches one resource itself. **Candidate.** |

Then intersect `API-CALL` with the provider's **discovery targets** — that
intersection is where the cost is, because a discovery target resolves its own
resource once per asset:

```bash
grep -n "Discovery[A-Z][A-Za-z]* *=" providers/<name>/resources/discovery.go
grep -l "getAssetIdentifier\|getAssetName" providers/<name>/resources/*.go
```

An `API-CALL` init that is *not* a discovery target is reached through typed
accessors instead — one call per **reference** rather than per asset. Its cost
is set by fan-in, so count the referring call sites before sizing it:

```bash
rg -c "NewResource\([^)]*\"<resource.mql.name>\"" providers/<name>/resources/*.go | grep -v _test
```

### The classifier's blind spot: accessors that never reach an init

**`classify-inits.awk` only reads `init` functions, so an accessor that builds a
client and fetches inline is invisible to it.** Such an accessor never calls
`NewResource`, never enters an init, and therefore cannot be fixed by anything
in Phase 4 — while an audit that only ran the classifier will read as complete.

Enumerate them properly rather than grepping for client construction in a
window — that over-counts badly. And **do not pin the receiver name**: providers
use `a`, `g`, `k`, `o`, `r`, `m`, `c`, `p`, `i`. Pinning one silently reports
zero for every provider that picked another letter.

Real counts, receiver-agnostic:

| provider | INLINE | BOTH | VIA-NEW |
|---|---|---|---|
| aws | 41 | 6 | 550 |
| azure | 38 | 0 | 136 |
| github | 16 | 1 | 5 |
| ms365 | 14 | 0 | 11 |
| gcp | 10 | 0 | 71 |
| okta | 1 | 0 | 4 |
| k8s | **0** | 0 | 23 |

k8s at zero is the shape to aim for. Everything else has some.

```bash
awk -f .claude/skills/provider-api-call-dedup/classify-accessors.awk \
    providers/<name>/resources/*.go | cut -f1 | sort | uniq -c
```

**Then split them by fan-in, because most are not worth touching.** An inline
accessor falls into one of two kinds:

| Kind | Shape | Worth fixing |
|---|---|---|
| **Owned sub-object** | A config child belonging to exactly one parent — a database's audit policy, a storage account's management policy, a site's auth settings | **No.** One fetch per parent is the floor, and `GetOrCompute` already memoizes it on that parent. Nothing repeats |
| **Shared resource** | A subnet, a public IP, a firewall policy, a disk — something several resources point at | **Yes.** Fan-in means repeats, and nothing dedupes them |

In azure that split is roughly 30 owned sub-objects against ~12 shared targets,
so the backlog is small and specific, not half the provider. Measure fan-in per
target before proposing anything:

```bash
rg -c "\"<target.mql.name>\"" providers/<name>/resources/*.go | grep -v _test | wc -l
```

## Phase 3 — Scope the resource cache

```bash
rg -n "WithParentConnectionId" providers/<name> -g '*.go' | grep -v _test
```

No hits means every asset is paying for its own copy of everything. Fix that
first: it is the larger win and it makes Phase 4 measurable. Hits mean the
provider shares *something* — read them and write down **at which level**, then
run the gate below anyway, because sharing at the wrong level is the more
dangerous state of the two.

**Check the scope is safe.** Find every place a resource reads its scope from
the *connection* rather than from its own id or args:

```bash
# whatever the provider calls its scope: SubId, ProjectID, AccountId, ResourceID
rg -c "conn\.(SubId|ProjectID|AccountId|ResourceID)\(\)" providers/<name>/resources -g '*.go'
```

Every hit is a place where a cache shared across two scopes returns **the wrong
scope's answer instead of failing**. The sharp test is per init: does it honour
`args` for the scope, and only fall back to the connection when they are absent?
An init that reads the connection unconditionally will answer for whichever
scope connected first.

```bash
# inits that fall back to the connection without first honouring args
rg -l "conn\.(SubId|ProjectID|AccountId|ResourceID)\(\)" providers/<name>/resources -g '*.go'
```

`initGcpProject` (`providers/gcp/resources/project.go`) is the worked fix: it
resolves the project the *caller* asked for and documents why in place. Also
look for a singleton memo on a root resource (azure pins the subscription on
`mqlAzure.sub`), which pins the first scope connected for the whole run.

If the provider discovers many scopes from one root connection, there is no
per-scope connection to parent onto yet — that is what staged discovery builds.
**REQUIRED SUB-SKILL:** use `staged-discovery` for that half.

## Phase 4 — Migrate inits

Three shapes, picked by what the init is resolving. They compose in this order:
**cache first, then the list, then fetch.**

| Shape | Use for | Miss behaviour |
|---|---|---|
| **cache-first** | Anything where the caller supplies the id | Fall through to the next shape |
| **from-list** | An **asset** the scan was handed | **Error** — the asset should be there |
| **list-first-with-fallback** | A **typed reference** | Fall through to the existing fetch |

### Cache-first

`NewResource` cannot check the cache before the init in general, because the key
is the resolved `MqlID()`. But when the caller already supplied the id — which
reference resolution always does — the key is known up front, so the init can
look it up before spending a call:

```go
if cached := cachedResource(runtime, ResourceFooBar, id); cached != nil {
    return args, cached, nil
}
```

Cheap, no pre-flight needed, and the only option when there is no list to
resolve from. The lookup is exact, because that is how the runtime keys the
cache; a casing mismatch simply falls through to the fetch, as today.

### From-list and list-first

Target shape, mirroring k8s's `initNamespacedResource`
(`providers/k8s/resources/common.go`): resolve the parent service, walk its
already-fetched list, return the instance that is there. With more than a couple
of resources, write one shared generic helper rather than copying the body.

**Asset inits and reference inits need different miss behaviour.** For an asset,
a miss means something is wrong — error. For a typed reference, a miss is
routine: it may point at another scope, at something deleted, or at something
the caller cannot read. Existing inits usually say so in a comment; converting
them to a hard error turns graceful degradation into a failed query. Give
references a lookup that returns nil and let the caller keep its own fetch.

A reference lookup should also **skip the list when the id names a different
scope** than the connection — the list only covers this one, so consulting it
wastes the walk and risks matching a same-named resource elsewhere.

**Run three pre-flight checks per resource. Skipping the second or third ships a
regression.**

1. **Does a sibling list accessor exist** returning the same resource type?
2. **Do the list and the init build the resource the same way?** If they share a
   builder (`fooToMql`), migrating is a pure win. If the init sets fields or
   primes caches the list does not, the list is a *reduced projection* and
   migrating **adds** a call per resource. Fix the list first — often a
   different SDK pager returns full objects (azure Key Vault: `List` returns a
   bare `TrackedResource`, `ListBySubscription` returns the full `Vault`).
3. **Do both ids come from the same API?** An asset's id usually comes from a
   generic inventory endpoint while the list comes from a service endpoint, and
   clouds do not agree with themselves on casing between the two. Match with
   `strings.EqualFold`, never `==`.

Two rules for the body:

- For an **asset** init, a miss is an **error**, never `return args, nil, nil` —
  falling through has the runtime build a blank resource whose fields are unset
  rather than null, which surfaces client-side as an untyped null with nothing
  pointing at the cause.
- Keep the `len(args) > N` fast path, so callers that already supplied
  everything do not trigger a list walk.

**State the trade in the PR.** Resolving one asset in isolation now pulls the
whole scope's list instead of one record. That is right during a scan, where the
list is wanted anyway, and wrong for a one-off shell query against a single
asset.

## Gotchas

| Symptom | Cause |
|---|---|
| Child assets re-fetch everything despite a parent id | Parent runtime already closed, or the parent id belongs to another provider. `service.go` logs `parent connection not found` — grep for it |
| A whole scope's assets report another scope's data | Cache shared above the scope the resources read off the connection |
| Traversal ends at the parent; no leaf assets appear | Child config was cloned `WithoutDiscovery()`; the next stage needs its targets |
| Every leaf re-runs discovery for the whole scope | Leaf config kept its discovery targets; leaves must be cloned `WithoutDiscovery()` |
| Init-resolved asset reports "not found" for a resource that exists | Case-sensitive id comparison |
| Migrating an init *increased* calls | The list is a reduced projection; pre-flight check 2 |
| A reference resolves fine but the fix changes nothing | The accessor fetches inline and never enters an init — see the classifier's blind spot |
| A converted reference now errors where it used to return a bare reference | A reference miss must fall through, not error; only asset inits error |
| Field count looks right but every value is empty | Counting lines, not resolved values |

## Done criteria

- Before/after call counts from the same query, both logs provenance-checked,
  and the probe confirmed to reach the changed code
- Per-resource calls equal the number of **distinct resources**, not assets
