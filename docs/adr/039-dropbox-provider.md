# ADR-039: Dropbox Provider Implementation

**Status:** Proposed
**Date:** 2026-08-08
**Author:** (Engineering Team)

---

## Context

Dropbox Business (the team-plan tier of Dropbox) exposes a REST API for team administration: enumerating members, groups, linked devices, linked third-party apps, and team-wide security settings (SSO enforcement, two-step verification requirements, sharing restrictions, file-transfer limits). Unlike the personal Dropbox API, every Business endpoint lives under the `/2/team/...` namespace and is authorized with a team-scoped OAuth access token issued to a Dropbox Business App, not a per-user token. There is no complex resource graph to model (no IAM policy trees, no networking) and pagination follows one consistent `*/list` + `*/list/continue` cursor shape across almost every list endpoint, making this a good candidate for a small, security-focused provider: the goal is visibility into team security posture (who has 2FA, whether SSO is required, which devices and third-party apps are linked to member accounts), not general file/content access.

**Client selection.** Per the provider client-selection priority ladder (1: official vendor Go SDK, 2: harmonize with the vendor's Terraform provider + generate from OpenAPI v3, 3: hand-written `net/http` client as a last resort), this ADR lands on rung 1: `dropbox-sdk-go-unofficial` lives in the `dropbox` GitHub org and is machine-generated from Dropbox's own Stone API spec, making it the vendor SDK despite the "unofficial" name in its module path (a historical artifact of it predating Dropbox formally adopting the repo). A web search for a mainstream Dropbox Business Terraform provider turned up nothing: the only public listing (`callensm/dropbox` on the Terraform Registry) is a small, independently maintained, individual-author provider covering personal file/folder resources, not the `team/...` Business admin surface this ADR needs, and it is not vendor-published — so rung 2 (Terraform harmonization) does not apply here, it was checked and found inapplicable rather than skipped.

## Resource Schema (`dropbox.lr`)

```lr
option provider = "go.mondoo.com/mql/providers/dropbox"
option go_package = "go.mondoo.com/mql/v13/providers/dropbox/resources"

// Dropbox Business team
//
// Root of a Dropbox Business team account, reachable through a
// team-scoped access token. Exposes the team's identity and size via
// `team`, the members enrolled in it, the groups used to manage sharing
// and permissions, the devices linked to member accounts, and the
// third-party apps members have authorized. Use this resource to audit
// a team's overall security posture: authentication requirements,
// external sharing exposure, and the devices and apps with standing
// access to team data.

// Dropbox Business team account
//
// Team-wide identity and configuration returned by `team/get_info` and
// `team/features/get_values`. Carries the settings that shape a team's
// authentication and sharing posture: whether single sign-on is
// required, the file-upload API rate limit, and the team's member
// counts. There is one `team` per Dropbox Business account.

// Dropbox Business team member
//
// A single member enrolled in the team, selected by `teamMemberId` as

}

// Device linked to a Dropbox Business member account
//
// A single client session or linked device for a team member, as
// returned by `team/devices/list_members_devices`. Covers both desktop
// and mobile clients as well as active web sessions, distinguished by
// `clientType`. Use `lastActivity` to find stale sessions that should
// be revoked.
dropbox.device @defaults("clientType hostName") {
  // Session or device ID

// `team/linked_apps/list_members_linked_apps`. Use this to audit the
// blast radius of third-party integrations with standing access to
// team content.

  // App ID
  appId string
  // App display name
  appName string
  // App publisher name
  publisherName string
  // Publisher's URL, empty when not provided by the app

```

## Authentication

Single team-scoped access token, following the Shodan single-token pattern (`providers/shodan/connection/connection.go`):

```go
type DropboxConnection struct {
    plugin.Connection
    Conf   *inventory.Config
    asset  *inventory.Asset
    client team.Client
}

func NewDropboxConnection(id uint32, asset *inventory.Asset, conf *inventory.Config) (*DropboxConnection, error) {
    conn := &DropboxConnection{
        Connection: plugin.NewConnection(id, asset),
        Conf:       conf,
        asset:      asset,
    }

    token := os.Getenv("DROPBOX_TEAM_TOKEN")
    if len(conf.Credentials) > 0 {
        for _, cred := range conf.Credentials {
            if cred.Type == vault.CredentialType_password {
                token = string(cred.Secret)
            }
        }
    }
    if token == "" {
        return nil, errors.New("a valid Dropbox Business team access token is required (set DROPBOX_TEAM_TOKEN or use --token)")
    }

    config := dropbox.Config{
        Token:    token,
        LogLevel: dropbox.LogOff,
    }
    conn.client = team.New(config)

    return conn, nil
}
```

Notes:
- The token must come from a Dropbox **Business App** (App Console, "Scoped access" with team-level permission type). A regular per-user app token is rejected by every `team/...` endpoint with an `invalid_access_token` error.
- Required scopes for the resources modeled here: `team_info.read` (`team/get_info`, `team/features/get_values`), `members.read` (`team/members/list`), `groups.read` (`team/groups/list`), and `sessions.list` (`team/devices/list_members_devices`, `team/linked_apps/list_members_linked_apps`). No write scopes are needed since this provider is read-only.

## Implementation Patterns

### Generic Cursor Pagination (`*/list` + `*/list/continue`)

Nearly every Dropbox Business list endpoint follows the same two-call shape: an initial `X/list` call that accepts a page-size limit and returns a `cursor` plus `has_more`, followed by repeated `X/list/continue` calls (taking only the cursor) until `has_more` is false. Model this once and reuse it:

```go
// pagination.go

// pagedFetch abstracts the Dropbox "list" + "list/continue" cursor pattern.
// first calls the initial X/list endpoint; next calls X/list/continue with
// the returned cursor. Both return the page's items, the next cursor, and
// whether more pages remain.
func pagedFetch[T any](
    first func() ([]T, string, bool, error),
    next func(cursor string) ([]T, string, bool, error),
) ([]T, error) {
    items, cursor, hasMore, err := first()
    if err != nil {
        return nil, err
    }
    all := append([]T{}, items...)
    for hasMore {
        items, cursor, hasMore, err = next(cursor)
        if err != nil {
            return nil, err
        }
        all = append(all, items...)
    }
    return all, nil
}
```

Usage for members:

```go
func (d *mqlDropbox) members() ([]any, error) {
    conn := d.MqlRuntime.Connection.(*connection.DropboxConnection)
    client := conn.Client()

    members, err := pagedFetch(
        func() ([]*team.TeamMemberInfo, string, bool, error) {
            resp, err := client.MembersListV2(&team.MembersListArg{Limit: 1000})
            if err != nil {
                return nil, "", false, err
            }
            return resp.Members, resp.Cursor, resp.HasMore, nil
        },
        func(cursor string) ([]*team.TeamMemberInfo, string, bool, error) {
            resp, err := client.MembersListContinueV2(&team.MembersListContinueArg{Cursor: cursor})
            if err != nil {
                return nil, "", false, err
            }
            return resp.Members, resp.Cursor, resp.HasMore, nil
        },
    )
    if err != nil {
        return nil, err
    }

    var all []any
    for _, m := range members {
        r, err := CreateResource(d.MqlRuntime, "dropbox.member", map[string]*llx.RawData{
            "teamMemberId":     llx.StringData(m.Profile.TeamMemberId),
            "email":            llx.StringData(m.Profile.Email),
            "emailVerified":    llx.BoolData(m.Profile.EmailVerified),
            "displayName":      llx.StringData(m.Profile.Name.DisplayName),
            "status":           llx.StringData(m.Profile.Status.Tag),
            "membershipType":   llx.StringData(m.Profile.MembershipType.Tag),
            "role":             llx.StringData(roleName(m.Role)),
            "twoFactorEnabled": llx.BoolData(m.Profile.Secondary2Fa),
            "secondaryEmails":  llx.ArrayData(convert.SliceAnyToInterface(secondaryEmails(m.Profile.SecondaryEmails)), types.String),
            "joinedAt":         llx.TimeDataPtr(m.Profile.JoinedOn),
        })
        if err != nil {
            return nil, err
        }
        all = append(all, r)
    }
    return all, nil
}
```

### Team Settings from `team/features/get_values`

Some security-relevant settings (SSO state, upload rate limit) are not part of `team/get_info` and require a separate `team/features/get_values` call requesting specific feature values. Fetch and cache these once alongside `team/get_info` when the `team()` accessor is first resolved:

```go
func (d *mqlDropbox) team() (*mqlDropboxTeam, error) {
    conn := d.MqlRuntime.Connection.(*connection.DropboxConnection)
    client := conn.Client()

    info, err := client.GetInfo()
    if err != nil {
        return nil, err
    }

    features, err := client.FeaturesGetValues(&team.FeaturesGetValuesBatchArg{
        Features: []*team.Feature{
            &team.Feature{Tagged: mkTag("upload_api_rate_limit")},
            &team.Feature{Tagged: mkTag("has_team_selective_sync")},
        },
    })
    if err != nil {
        // feature values are a nice-to-have; degrade gracefully rather than
        // failing the whole team() resolution
        log.Warn().Err(err).Msg("failed to fetch dropbox team feature values")
    }

    r, err := CreateResource(d.MqlRuntime, "dropbox.team", map[string]*llx.RawData{
        "__id":                 llx.StringData(info.TeamId),
        "id":                   llx.StringData(info.TeamId),
        "name":                 llx.StringData(info.Name),
        "numLicensedUsers":     llx.IntData(int64(info.NumLicensedUsers)),
        "numProvisionedUsers":  llx.IntData(int64(info.NumProvisionedUsers)),
        "uploadApiRateLimit":   llx.IntData(uploadRateLimitFrom(features)),
        // ssoState/ssoRequired/twoStepVerificationRequired come from
        // team/team_policies exposed on GetInfo's policies field, or a
        // second features batch, depending on the app's granted scopes.
    })
    if err != nil {
        return nil, err
    }
    return r.(*mqlDropboxTeam), nil
}
```

### Member-Scoped Sub-Resources (devices, linked apps)

`team/devices/list_members_devices` and `team/linked_apps/list_members_linked_apps` both return their results grouped by `team_member_id` in a single paginated call, not one call per member. Fetch once, cache in an `Internal` struct on the root resource, and let both `dropbox.devices()` (flat, team-wide) and `dropbox.member.devices()` (filtered) read from the same cache:

```go
type mqlDropboxInternal struct {
    devicesOnce   sync.Once
    devicesByUser map[string][]any
    devicesErr    error
}

func (d *mqlDropbox) fetchDevicesByUser() (map[string][]any, error) {
    d.devicesOnce.Do(func() {
        conn := d.MqlRuntime.Connection.(*connection.DropboxConnection)
        client := conn.Client()
        result := map[string][]any{}

        pages, err := pagedFetch(
            func() ([]*team.MembersListMemberDevicesResult, string, bool, error) { /* ... */ },
            func(cursor string) ([]*team.MembersListMemberDevicesResult, string, bool, error) { /* ... */ },
        )
        if err != nil {
            d.devicesErr = err
            return
        }
        for _, page := range pages {
            for _, dev := range page.ActiveWebSessions {
                r, err := CreateResource(d.MqlRuntime, "dropbox.device", map[string]*llx.RawData{
                    "__id":       llx.StringData(page.TeamMemberId + "/" + dev.SessionId),
                    "id":         llx.StringData(dev.SessionId),
                    "clientType": llx.StringData("web"),
                    // ...
                })
                if err != nil {
                    d.devicesErr = err
                    return
                }
                result[page.TeamMemberId] = append(result[page.TeamMemberId], r)
            }
            // same pattern for DesktopClients and MobileClientSessions
        }
        d.devicesByUser = result
    })
    return d.devicesByUser, d.devicesErr
}
```

## Security Policies (MVP)

Ship as `mondoo-dropbox-security.mql.yaml`:

**Authentication:**
- Team members must have two-step verification enabled
- Team must require single sign-on (`ssoRequired == true`)
- Suspended or long-pending invited members must be reviewed and removed

**Access Governance:**
- Number of `team_admin` role members must be limited (principle of least privilege)
- Team must not allow unrestricted external sharing
- Team must not allow public shared links, or must restrict them to view-only

**Third-Party Exposure:**
- Linked third-party apps must be reviewed; apps with full-account access (`isAppFolder == false`) flagged for scrutiny
- Linked devices must be reviewed; sessions with stale `lastActivity` flagged for revocation

**Example checks:**

```yaml
- uid: dropbox-members-2fa-enabled
  title: Ensure all team members have two-step verification enabled
  mql: |
    dropbox.members.all(twoFactorEnabled == true)

- uid: dropbox-sso-required
  title: Ensure the team requires single sign-on
  mql: |
    dropbox.team.ssoRequired == true

- uid: dropbox-external-sharing-restricted
  title: Ensure external sharing is restricted
  mql: |
    dropbox.team.externalSharingAllowed == false

- uid: dropbox-admin-count-limited
  title: Ensure the number of team admins is limited
  mql: |
    dropbox.members.where(role == "team_admin").length <= 3

- uid: dropbox-no-stale-invited-members
  title: Ensure invited members are not left pending indefinitely
  mql: |
    dropbox.members.where(status == "invited").length == 0
```

## Registration

Add to these files (alphabetically):

1. **`providers/defaults.go`** — Provider entry with connection type and flags
2. **`README.md`** — Row in provider table
3. **`DEVELOPMENT.md`** — `providers/dropbox` in `go.work` list
4. **`Makefile`** — `dropbox` in `PROVIDERS` list

---

## Build & Test

```bash
# Generate resource code
make providers/mqlr
./mqlr generate providers/dropbox/resources/dropbox.lr \
  --dist providers/dropbox/resources

# Build and install
make providers/build/dropbox && make providers/install/dropbox

# Test
export DROPBOX_TEAM_TOKEN="sl.xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
mql shell dropbox
> dropbox.team { name numLicensedUsers ssoRequired twoStepVerificationRequired }
> dropbox.members { email status role twoFactorEnabled }
> dropbox.groups { name memberCount managementType }
> dropbox.devices { clientType hostName lastActivity }
> dropbox.linkedApps { appName publisherName isAppFolder }
```

---

## Implementation Order

1. Scaffold via `go run apps/provider-scaffold/provider-scaffold.go --path providers/dropbox --provider-id dropbox --provider-name "Dropbox"` then `cd providers/dropbox && go mod tidy`
2. Root + Team (validates auth, exercises `team/get_info` and `team/features/get_values`)
3. Generic cursor pagination helper (`pagination.go`), shared by every list resource
4. Members (core security resource: 2FA, role, status)
5. Groups
6. Devices (member-scoped fetch-once cache, exposed both flat and per-member)
7. Linked Apps (same member-scoped cache pattern as Devices)
8. Security policies
9. Discovery
10. Registration (`defaults.go`, `README.md`, `DEVELOPMENT.md`, `Makefile`)
