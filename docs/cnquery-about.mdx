-> To install and get up and running quickly, read [Get Started with cnquery](/cnquery/).

cnquery is Mondoo's open source, cloud-native tool that answers every question about your infrastructure. Built upon Mondoo's advanced security data fabric, it integrates with [over 850 resources](/mql/resources) to provide quick insight into your operations and development platforms.

Use cnquery to learn about your systems and reveal information that would otherwise be difficult or impossible to uncover. For example:

- Aggregate all packages installed across containers, regardless of the OS.
- Find cloud instances exposed to the internet.
- Reveal old certificates on Kubernetes clusters.

Now consider what's possible when you write automation around cnquery. It's an incredibly broad and versatile tool for solving DevOps challenges.

Our query language is MQL, which combines a graph database approach and powerful filters. Simply describe what you want, and get only the results you need—fast! To explore MQL's capabilities, browse the [MQL docs](/mql/resources).
