cnquery can provide answers about your Microsoft 365 environment. It can query any aspect of your Microsoft 365 configuration. For a list of Microsoft 365 resources you can query, read [Mondoo Microsoft 365 (M365) Resource Pack Reference](/mql/resources/ms365/) and [Mondoo Core Resource Pack Reference](/mql/resources/core/).

## Connect cnquery with your Microsoft 365 environment

### Requirements

To test your Microsoft 365 environment with cnquery, you must have:

- [cnquery installed on your workstation](/cnquery/).
- A [Microsoft 365 subscription](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365)
- The [Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) installed

### Give cnquery access through the Microsoft 365 API

To remotely scan your Microsoft 365 environment, cnquery must have API credentials with access to the subscription. Follow these steps to give cnquery access:

1.  Log into the Azure CLI:

```bash
az login --allow-no-subscriptions
```

2. Create a new service principal and certificate:

```bash
az ad sp create-for-rbac --name "mondoo-m365" --create-cert
```

3. Record the `appId` and `tenant` values to use later. Copy the newly created certificate file to a safe location.

4. Log into the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), navigate to **App Registrations**, select the **All applications** tab, and select the application you just created.

5. In the sidebar, expand **Manage** and select **API Permissions**.

   ![Azure Admin Center App Registrations](/img/cnquery/m365/aad.portal.azure.registration.complete.png)

   By default, Microsoft grants your new application with `User.Read` permission for Microsoft Graph. It's not required for Mondoo, so you can remove it.

6. Select **Add a permission**.

   ![Azure Admin Center App Registrations](/img/cnquery/m365/aad.portal.azure.apipermissions.add.png)

7. From the list of **Commonly used Microsoft APIs**, select **Microsoft Graph**.

   ![Azure Admin Center App Registrations](/img/cnquery/m365/aad.portal.azure.apipermissions.graph.png)

8. Because Mondoo acts as a service, select **Application permissions**. Then select the following API permissions:

### Verify with a quick Microsoft 365 query

To quickly confirm that cnquery has access to your Microsoft 365 environment, run this check from your terminal:

```bash
cnquery run ms365 -c 'microsoft.organizations { id }' --tenant-id TENANT_ID_HERE
```

cnquery lists your Microsoft organizations' IDs.

You've successfully used cnquery to query your Microsoft 365 environment. Now you're ready to explore. The method you choose depends on your goals:

## Query Microsoft 365

To answer any question about your environment, use cnquery's interactive shell. It has auto-complete to guide you, which is especially helpful when you're new to cnquery and learning MQL.

To launch a shell into your Azure environment, enter:

```bash
cnquery shell ms365 --tenant-id TENANT_ID_HERE
```

### Discover capabilities with the `help` command

Once inside the shell, use the `help` command to learn what Microsoft 365 resources you can query. This command lists all the Microsoft 365 resources:

```coffeescript
help ms365
```

To see all microsoft resources run:

```coffeescript
help microsoft
```

From the resulting list, you can drill down further. For example, enter this command to list all the Microsoft domain resources you can query:

```coffeescript
help microsoft.domain
```

From the resulting list, you can drill down even further. You can also learn about available Azure resources in the [Mondoo Microsoft 365 (M365) Resource Pack Reference](/mql/resources/ms365/).

### Query storage accounts

Now that you know how to discover what's possible with cnquery, let's run some actual queries in the shell.

This query lists all the current domains:

```coffeescript
microsoft.domains
```

#### Request full details in results

For a more detailed report, you can specify that you want all fields:

```coffeescript
microsoft.domains { * }
```

For each domain, cnquery lists type, availability, supported services, and more.

#### Specify fields to include in results

If you're interested in only some details, specify the fields you want in braces. For example, this query asks for each domain's ID, password validity period, and whether the domain is admin managed:

```coffeescript
microsoft.domains { id passwordValidityPeriodInDays isAdminManaged }
```

#### Filter results

You can filter results based on any fields. Specify the criteria using the `where` function and standard boolean operators.

For example, this filters results to show only domains that have passwords that expire:

```coffeescript
microsoft.domains.where(passwordValidityPeriodInDays != 2147483647) { id availabilityStatus }
```

cnquery returns all domains with passwords that can expire. It includes the ID and availability status for each one.

### Exit the cnquery shell

To exit the cnquery shell, either press `Ctrl + D` or type `exit`.
