To [query GitHub organizations and repos](/cnquery/saas/github/), cnquery needs to authenticate with GitHub. There are two ways to do this:

- Option 1: Give cnquery access using a personal access token and an environment variable. This approach is easier to set up but results isn't recommended for very large GitHub organizations. To learn how to give cnquery access using a personal access token, read [Give cnquery access using a personal access token and an environment variable](/cnquery/saas/github/).

- Option 2: Give cnquery access using custom GitHub application credentials. This approach takes longer to set up, but scales for very large GitHub organizations (with API rate limits as much as 3x higher than personal access tokens). To learn how to give cnquery access using custom app credentials, continue reading below.

For cnquery to authenticate with GitHub using [custom GitHub application credentials](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/creating-github-apps), create a GitHub application and give cnquery the app ID, private key, and installation ID.

## Create a GitHub application and get the authentication information cnquery needs

1. In the top-right corner of any page on GitHub, select your profile icon.

2. Open your account settings:
   - To create an app owned by a personal account, select **Settings**.
   - To create an app owned by an organization, select **Your organizations** and, to the right of the organization you want, select **Settings**.

3. In the left sidebar, select **Developer settings**.

4. In the left sidebar, select GitHub Apps.

5. Select the **New GitHub App** button.

6. In the **GitHub App name** box, type a name for your app that helps you easily recognize that it's for Mondoo. The name must be unique across GitHub.

7. In the **Description** box, write that this app provides authentication for Mondoo queries.

8. In the **Homepage URL** box, type `https://mondoo.com/cnquery` or your own company URL.

9. Skip past the settings under **Identifying and authorizing users** and **Post installation**.

10. Under **Webhooks**, uncheck the **Active** box.

11. Under **Permissions**, select **Read-only** for all repository and organization settings that offer read-only access. If a setting doesn't offer read-only access, leave it set to **No access**.

12. Under **Where can this GitHub App be installed?**, select **Only on this account**.

    ![Add a new GitHub app](/img/cnquery/github/create-gh-app.png)

13. Select the **Create GitHub App** button.

    GitHub creates the app and displays its properties.

    ![Created GitHub app](/img/cnquery/github/created-app.png)

14. In the **About** section, copy the **App ID** value and save it somewhere that you can access later. You need it when you query.

15. Scroll down to the **Private keys** section and select the **Generate a private key** button.

    GitHub creates a new private key and downloads it to your workstation in a PEM certificate file. Note the path to the PEM file; you need it when you query.

16. In the left sidebar, select **Install App**.

17. Install your custom app to any repo so that you can see its installation ID.

    GitHub installs the app and displays a confirmation.

    ![Install a new GitHub app](/img/cnquery/github/install-success.png)

    In your browser's address bar, find the installation ID in the URL, after `/installations/`. For example, the pictured app's installation ID is `56758584`. Copy this value and save it somewhere that you can access later. You need it when you query.

## Query using your custom app credentials

Enter the `cnquery shell` command, passing the information you stored in the steps above:

| For...                       | Substitute...                                         |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `YOUR-GITHUB-ORG`            | The name of the GitHub organization you want to query |
| `YOUR-GITHUB-APP-ID`         | The app ID from step 13                               |
| `YOUR-GITHUB-APP-INSTALL-ID` | The installation ID from step 16                      |
| `PATH-TO-PEM-FILE`           | The path you noted in step 14                         |

```bash
cnquery shell github org <YOUR-GITHUB-ORG> --app-id <YOUR-GITHUB-APP-ID> --app-installation-id <YOUR-GITHUB-APP-INSTALL-ID> --app-private-key <PATH-TO-PEM-FILE>
```
