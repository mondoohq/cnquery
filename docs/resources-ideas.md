# Resources Ideas

This is list of ideas for resources and resources improvements. Feel free to add PRs to expand this file.

To make suggestions, please follow this schema:

```md
## provider

- resource
  - field: type, what it does ...
    # add example usage here
  - field: type, short info
```

- sections are organized by providers
  - to suggest a new provider just add it as a section and add some context (what it does, why, examples)
- every provider can have a list of resources
  - to add a new resource just add it and show how it would be used with an example
  - to consolidate or remove one or more resources just describe it
- every resource can have one or more fields
  - to add a new field just add it

We will regularly review this document and cross things off as they get done.
