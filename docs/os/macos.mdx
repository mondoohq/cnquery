cnquery provides the answers you need about every macOS configuration. For example, you can retrieve the platform version, user information, or whether remote login is enabled.

For a list of macOS resources you can query, read [Mondoo Operating Systems (OS) Resource Pack Reference](/mql/resources/os/) and [Mondoo Core Resource Pack Reference](/mql/resources/core/).

## Requirements

To explore a macOS asset with cnquery, you must have:

- [cnquery installed on your workstation](/cnquery/)
- Access to the asset

## Query a macOS asset

To answer any question about your environment, use cnquery's interactive shell. It has auto-complete to guide you, which is especially helpful when you're new to cnquery and learning MQL.

To launch a shell into your local macOS environment, enter:

```bash
cnquery shell
```

To launch a shell into a remote macOS environment, enter:

```bash
cnquery shell ssh user@IP_ADDRESS
```

For `IP_ADDRESS`, substitute the IP address of the remote macOS asset.

### Discover capabilities with the `help` command

Once inside the shell, use the `help` command to learn what macOS resources you can query. This command lists all the macOS resources:

```coffeescript
help macos
```

From the resulting list, you can drill down further. For example, enter this command to list all the macOS machine settings you can query:

```coffeescript
help macos.systemsetup
```

From the resulting list, you can drill down even further. You can also learn about available macOS resources in the [Mondoo Operating Systems (OS) Resource Pack Reference](/mql/resources/os/) and [Mondoo Core Resource Pack Reference](/mql/resources/core/).

### Query macOS application layer firewall (ALF)

Now that you know how to discover what's possible with cnquery, let's run some actual queries in the shell.

This query ask whether the firewall is enabled:

```coffeescript
macos.alf.globalState
```

cnquery returns `0` for no and `1` for yes.

### Query users

To request a list of all users on a machine, enter this query in the shell:

```coffeescript
users
```

<Callout>
  In this query, you don't specify `macos`. That's because the `user` resource is in the [Mondoo
  Core Resource Pack](/mql/resources/core/).
</Callout>
cnquery returns a list of all users on the system:

```coffeescript
users.list: [
  0: user name="_nsurlsessiond" uid=242 gid=242
  1: user name="_logd" uid=272 gid=272
  2: user name="_mailman" uid=78 gid=78
  3: user name="_jabber" uid=84 gid=84
  4: user name="_cyrus" uid=77 gid=6
  5: user name="_scsd" uid=31 gid=31
  6: user name="_installassistant" uid=25 gid=25
  7: user name="_ftp" uid=98 gid=-2
  8: user name="_appstore" uid=33 gid=33
  9: user name="_installer" uid=96 gid=-2
  10: user name="_cvmsroot" uid=212 gid=212
  11: user name="_screensaver" uid=203 gid=203

  ...

]
```

### Request full details in results

For a more detailed report, you can specify that you want all fields:

```coffeescript
users { * }
```

For every user, cnquery provides information about their settings:

```coffeescript
users.list: [
  0: {
    sid: ""
    enabled: false
    gid: 242
    shell: "/usr/bin/false"
    uid: 242
    authorizedkeys.list: stat /var/db/nsurlsessiond/.ssh/authorized_keys: permission denied
    home: "/var/db/nsurlsessiond"
    name: "_nsurlsessiond"
    group: group name="_nsurlsessiond" gid=242
    sshkeys: stat /var/db/nsurlsessiond/.ssh: permission denied
  }
  1: {
    sid: ""
    enabled: false
    gid: 272
    shell: "/usr/bin/false"
    uid: 272
    authorizedkeys.list: []
    home: "/var/db/diagnostics"
    name: "_logd"
    group: group name="_logd" gid=272
    sshkeys: []
  }
  2: {
    sid: ""
    enabled: false
    gid: 78
    shell: "/usr/bin/false"
    uid: 78
    authorizedkeys.list: []
    home: "/var/empty"
    name: "_mailman"
    group: group name="_mailman" gid=78
    sshkeys: []
  }

...

]
```

### Specify fields to include in results

If you're interested in only some details, specify the fields you want in braces. For example, this query asks for each user's name, group, and whether it's a shell user:

```coffeescript
users { name group shell }
```

cnquery returns results like this:

```coffeescript
users.list: [
  0: {
    shell: "/usr/bin/false"
    name: "_nsurlsessiond"
    group: group name="_nsurlsessiond" gid=242
  }
  1: {
    shell: "/usr/bin/false"
    name: "_logd"
    group: group name="_logd" gid=272
  }
  2: {
    shell: "/usr/bin/false"
    name: "_mailman"
    group: group name="_mailman" gid=78
  }

...

]
```

### Filter results

You can filter results based on any fields. Specify the criteria using the `where` function and standard boolean operators.

For example, this filters results based on group name:

```coffeescript
users.where(group.name == "nobody") { name uid home }
```

cnquery returns all users in the `nobody` group. It includes the name, UID, and home directory for each user.

```coffeescript
users.where.list: [
  0: {
    uid: 98
    name: "_ftp"
    home: "/var/empty"
  }
  1: {
    uid: 96
    name: "_installer"
    home: "/var/empty"
  }
  2: {
    uid: 234
    name: "_krb_anonymous"
    home: "/var/empty"
  }

  ...

]
```

## Learn more about querying macOS

- To learn more about how the MQL query language works, read [Write Effective MQL](/mql/mql-write).
- For a list of all the macOS resources and fields you can query, read the [Mondoo Operating Systems (OS) Resource Pack Reference](/mql/resources/os/) and [Mondoo Core Resource Pack Reference](/mql/resources/core/).

## Analyze your environment with query packs

Mondoo makes these [core macOS query packs](https://github.com/mondoohq/cnquery) available in GitHub:

- [macOS Inventory Pack](https://github.com/mondoohq/cnquery/blob/main/content/mondoo-macos-inventory.mql.yaml) provides information about all your macOS assets and their configuration.
- [macOS Incident Response Pack](https://github.com/mondoohq/cnquery/blob/main/content/mondoo-macos-incident-response.mql.yaml) helps you investigate and minimize damage when a security incident occurs.

To run one of these purpose-built collections of macOS-specific queries:

1. In Mondoo's [cnquery GitHub repo](https://github.com/mondoohq/cnquery), go to the `content` directory and find the macOS query pack you want to run.

2. Download the YAML file to a local directory and, in your terminal, move to that directory.

3. Use the `cnquery scan` command, specifying the file and the query pack:

```bash
cnquery scan -f mondoo-linux-incident-response.mql.yaml --querypack mondoo-incident-response-macos
```

You can also create your own query packs to meet your specific needs. To learn more about query packs, read [Run a Query Pack](/cnquery/cnquery-run-pack/).
