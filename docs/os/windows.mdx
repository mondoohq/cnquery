cnquery provides the answers you need about your Windows assets. For example, you can retrieve the Windows version, user information, or security settings.

For a list of Windows resources you can query, read [Mondoo Operating Systems (OS) Resource Pack Reference](/mql/resources/os/) and [Mondoo Core Resource Pack Reference](/mql/resources/core/).

## Requirements

To explore a Windows asset with cnquery, you must have:

- [cnquery installed on your workstation](/cnquery/)
- Access to the asset

## Query a Windows asset

To answer any question about your environment, use cnquery's interactive shell. It has auto-complete to guide you, which is especially helpful when you're new to cnquery and learning MQL.

To launch a shell into your local Windows environment, enter:

```bash
cnquery shell
```

To launch a shell into a remote Windows environment, enter:

```bash
cnquery shell ssh Administrator@IP_ADDRESS --ask-pass
```

For `IP_ADDRESS`, substitute the IP address of the remote Windows asset.

If you prefer WinRM for remote access, enter:

```bash
cnquery shell winrm Administrator@IP_ADDRESS --ask-pass
```

For `IP_ADDRESS`, substitute the IP address of the remote Windows asset.

### Discover capabilities with the `help` command

Once inside the shell, use the `help` command to learn what Windows resources you can query. This command lists all the operating system resources:

```coffeescript
help os
```

From the resulting list, you can drill down further. For example, enter this command to list the OS update information you can retrieve:

```coffeescript
help os.update
```

You can also learn about available Windows resources in the [Mondoo Operating Systems (OS) Resource Pack Reference](/mql/resources/os/) and [Mondoo Core Resource Pack Reference](/mql/resources/core/).

### Get simple answers in the shell

Now that you know how to discover what's possible with cnquery, let's run some actual queries in the shell.

This query asks the device name:

```coffeescript
asset.name
```

cnquery returns the pretty hostname:

```coffeescript
asset.name: "Mwezi's demo lappy"
```

This query asks the version of the operating system:

```coffeescript
asset.version
```

### Query users

To request a list of all users on a machine, enter this query in the shell:

```coffeescript
users
```

### Request full details in results

For a more detailed report, you can specify that you want all fields:

```coffeescript
users { * }
```

For every user, cnquery provides information about their settings.

### Specify fields to include in results

If you're interested in only some details, specify the fields you want in braces. For example, this query asks for each user's name, group, and whether it's enabled:

```coffeescript
users { name group enabled }
```

### Filter results

You can filter results based on any fields. Specify the criteria using the `where` function and standard boolean operators.

For example, this filters results based on group name:

```coffeescript
users.where(group.name == "admins") { name uid }
```

cnquery returns all users in the `admins` group. It includes the name and UID for each user.

## Learn more about querying Windows

- To learn more about how the MQL query language works, read [Write Effective MQL](/mql/mql-write).
- For a list of all the Windows resources and fields you can query, read the [Mondoo Operating Systems (OS) Resource Pack Reference](/mql/resources/os/) and [Mondoo Core Resource Pack Reference](/mql/resources/core/).

## Analyze your environment with query packs

Mondoo makes these [core Windows query packs](https://github.com/mondoohq/mql) available in GitHub:

- [Windows Asset Inventory Pack](https://github.com/mondoohq/mql/blob/main/content/mondoo-windows-inventory.mql.yaml) provides information about all your Windows assets and their configuration.
- [Windows Incident Response Pack](https://github.com/mondoohq/mql/blob/main/content/mondoo-windows-incident-response.mql.yaml) helps you investigate and minimize damage when a security incident occurs.

To run one of these purpose-built collections of Windows-specific queries:

1. In Mondoo's [cnquery GitHub repo](https://github.com/mondoohq/mql), go to the `content` directory and find the Windows query pack you want to run.

2. Download the YAML file to a local directory and, in your terminal, move to that directory.

3. Use the `cnquery scan` command, specifying the file and the query pack:

```coffeescript
cnquery scan -f mondoo-windows-incident-response.mql.yaml --querypack mondoo-incident-response-windows
```

You can also create your own query packs to meet your specific needs. To learn more about query packs, read [Run a Query Pack](/cnquery/cnquery-run-pack/).
